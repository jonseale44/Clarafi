# EMR System Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary
This EMR system has **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** that prevent deployment to production. The primary issue is direct exposure of OpenAI API keys in client-side code, which violates fundamental security principles required for healthcare systems.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. API Key Exposure (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
**Location**: `client/src/components/patient/encounter-detail-view.tsx`, `nursing-encounter-view.tsx`
**Issue**: OpenAI API key stored in environment variable `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and accessible in browser
```javascript
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY;
```
**Risk**: Any user can steal API key via browser DevTools, leading to:
- Unlimited API usage charges
- Data exfiltration 
- HIPAA violations
- Complete compromise of AI infrastructure

### 2. Direct Frontend-to-OpenAI WebSocket (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: WebSocket connects directly from browser to OpenAI with exposed credentials
```javascript
const protocols = [
  "realtime",
  `openai-insecure-api-key.${apiKey}`,  // API key in WebSocket protocol!
  "openai-beta.realtime-v1",
];
```
**Risk**: Network inspection reveals API keys in WebSocket handshake

### 3. Client-Side Session Creation (SEVERITY: HIGH)
**Issue**: OpenAI sessions created directly from browser
```javascript
const sessionResponse = await fetch(
  "https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,  // Exposed in browser
    },
  }
);
```

## Comparison to Production EMR Standards

### EPIC/Athena Security Model:
- **All API keys stored server-side only**
- **Zero trust client architecture**
- **End-to-end encryption for PHI**
- **Proxy all external API calls through backend**
- **Session-based authentication with RBAC**

### Current System:
- ❌ API keys in frontend code
- ❌ Direct browser-to-AI connections
- ❌ Credentials visible in DevTools
- ❌ No API key rotation mechanism
- ✅ Has authentication system (partial mitigation)
- ✅ Has some proxy endpoints (not used for primary flow)

## Required Fixes for Production Deployment

### 1. Immediate Actions (P0 - Must Fix)
1. **Remove all API keys from frontend**
   - Delete `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`
   - Remove all `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` references

2. **Implement WebSocket Proxy**
   - Create server-side WebSocket proxy for OpenAI realtime API
   - Handle all OpenAI authentication server-side
   - Frontend connects to your backend, backend connects to OpenAI

3. **Secure Session Management**
   - Move session creation to backend
   - Return only session tokens to frontend
   - Implement session expiration and rotation

### 2. Architecture Changes Required

#### Current (Insecure):
```
Browser → [API Key] → OpenAI WebSocket
Browser → [API Key] → OpenAI REST API
```

#### Required (Secure):
```
Browser → Your Backend → [API Key] → OpenAI WebSocket
Browser → Your Backend → [API Key] → OpenAI REST API
```

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: WebSocket Proxy (1-2 days)
- Create `/api/realtime/connect` endpoint
- Implement WebSocket proxy using `ws` package
- Handle bidirectional message relay
- Manage authentication and session lifecycle

#### Phase 2: Remove Frontend Keys (1 day)
- Update all components to use proxy
- Remove environment variables
- Update connection logic

#### Phase 3: Security Hardening (1 day)
- Add rate limiting
- Implement API key rotation
- Add request validation
- Audit logging for all AI interactions

## Code Examples for Fix

### Backend WebSocket Proxy (server/realtime-proxy.ts):
```typescript
import WebSocket from 'ws';

export function setupRealtimeProxy(app: Express) {
  const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ noServer: true });
  
  wss.on('connection', async (clientWs, request) => {
    // Verify user authentication
    const session = await verifySession(request);
    if (!session) {
      clientWs.close(1008, 'Unauthorized');
      return;
    }
    
    // Create OpenAI connection with server-side API key
    const openAiWs = new WebSocket('wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        'OpenAI-Beta': 'realtime=v1'
      }
    });
    
    // Relay messages bidirectionally
    clientWs.on('message', (data) => {
      openAiWs.send(data);
    });
    
    openAiWs.on('message', (data) => {
      clientWs.send(data);
    });
  });
}
```

### Updated Frontend Connection:
```typescript
// No more API key!
const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://${window.location.host}/api/realtime/connect`);
```

## Compliance Impact

### HIPAA Violations from Current Architecture:
- Unencrypted API keys violate encryption requirements
- No audit trail for AI interactions
- Potential for unauthorized PHI access via stolen keys

### Post-Fix Compliance:
- ✅ All credentials server-side only
- ✅ Full audit trail capability
- ✅ Encrypted data transmission
- ✅ Access control enforcement

## Conclusion

**This system CANNOT be deployed to production in its current state.** The exposed API keys represent a critical security vulnerability that would:
1. Fail any security audit
2. Violate HIPAA requirements
3. Expose the organization to unlimited financial liability
4. Risk patient data breach

**Estimated time to fix: 3-4 days with the provided implementation plan.**

The good news is that you already have the authentication infrastructure and some proxy endpoints in place. The fix primarily involves moving the WebSocket connection server-side and removing frontend API key access.
