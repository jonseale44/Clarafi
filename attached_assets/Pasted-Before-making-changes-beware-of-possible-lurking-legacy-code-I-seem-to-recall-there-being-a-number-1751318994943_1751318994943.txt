Before making changes, beware of possible lurking legacy code. I seem to recall there being a number of functions that use "hash comparisons". Also you mentioned the need to add change detection logic but you previously mentioned "there's already logic for detecting SOAP changes". Be careful not to duplicate any logic unless you have to. 
2. In the near future, I intend to continue developing each chart section (allergies, imaging, family history, etc) with the same parallel processing logic that we are using for medical problems, surgeries, vitals. Will I need to keep in mind that this new button will also need the same access as the "stop recording"?  If so, what is a good way to remind myself of this in the future? 

The only other question I have is the speed. Assuming the button is activated (because smart detection logic noted a content change in the SOAP note), can we assume that the processesing speed will always be the same regardless of how much the SOAP note changed? What I mean is, if the SOAP note only changes one thing, or the SOAp note change would only truly impact one section (e.g. surgical history), will the function still process through ALL sections regardless? What if those sections (particularly medical history), are incredibly long and complex? It seems like a waste of computing power to process everything. Again, just thinking out loud here/brainstorming. Maybe this is an opportunity to further leverage GPT's intelligence. Instead of using the frontend/regex logic to deteect SOAP changes, what if we just used GPT to do it. I.e. GPT could be the Smart Detector. This GPT APi call would exclusively be in charge of monitoring that SOAP note. It would only compare the SOAP note from whenever the SOAP note is accessed at the end of recording, to after the user has made changes point to another. It would NOT be monitoring the SOAP note compared to the medical chart (too much data). So if GPT decides the SOAP note changed considerably in terms of the past surgical history, it would activate the button which would then be prepared to update the surgical history section. If GPT decides the SOAP note changed considerably in terms of both past surgical history AND past medical history, then it would activate the button which would be prepared to update both the surgical history and medical history (but wouldn’t even look at the others). It’s like drilling a pilot hole before the big drill comes along. From the user’s perspective, the button would either be activated or not. The user doesn’t have to decide (or even be made aware of) which particular sections get updated when they press the button. The SOAP comparison could also consist of very simple “endpoints” for comparison. The first point A is simply whatever the SOAP note looks like at the moment the (stop recording) button is clicked. Comparison point B is whenever the SOAP note gets saved again which I believe happens when the user changes it, but it also sometimes happens a few seconds after the recording stops, because the final API call still has to go out and then come back. GPT would compare SOAP note between points A and B and then our smart button would activate which would only attempt to update those particular sections.
