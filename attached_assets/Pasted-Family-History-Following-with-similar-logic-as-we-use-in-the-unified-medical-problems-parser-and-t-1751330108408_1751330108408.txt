Family History: 
Following with similar logic as we use in the unified medical problems parser and the past surgical history, which successfully extracts information from the attachments and the encounter note to create a comprehensive medical problems list and surgical history list, respectively, I’d like to turn our attention to a similar function devoted to the family history. It’s first of all important to remember that this is a production-level EMR that must be designed to meet or exceed standards of care expected by EMRs such as Athena or Epic. To that end, we should first take into account industry standards when we consider all the appropriate categories for family history such as relationship (mother, father, etc), disease/illness/condition, etc. It must have the ability to update automatically from the attachments and the encounter AND be able to allow the user to update the family history manually (just like for the medical and surgical history). Let’s brainstorm and then go from there. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY code changes yet, just brainstorming. Please ask any questions you may have about my vision for the implementation. Some of the considerations we need to make include how we should structure the data and how to handle updates. You’ll notice in the medical problems, we have a system that allows problems to be UPDATED and consolidated. In both medical and surgical history sections the system automatically carries forward the visit history when consolidating. A lot of this isn’t really applicable to family history, but we will still need the ability to make updates and corrections. For example, suppose in one encounter the patient brings his medical record (uploaded via ATTACHMENT) which lists that his father has a history of CAD and is “currently alive age 80”. The family history would obviously be able to intelligently add that as a relevant family history. But then suppose at the next encounter the patient reports that his father died of a heart attack at age 83 years old. Both the initial and follow-up histories are relevant at the time they were reported, but should not coexist after the end of the second visit. They should be consolidated/updated intelligently. I want you to look very carefully at the medical history and surgical histories and use them as models for the family history. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY code changes yet, just brainstorming. Please ask any questions you may have about my vision for the implementation.
