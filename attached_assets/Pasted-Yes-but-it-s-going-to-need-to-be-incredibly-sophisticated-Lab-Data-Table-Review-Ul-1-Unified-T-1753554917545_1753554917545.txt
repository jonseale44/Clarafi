Yes but it’s going to need to be incredibly sophisticated.   Lab Data Table & Review Ul
1. Unified Table Layout:
• Display all lab results in a single table: labs/panels on
rows, dates horizontally as columns. The system must
scale to decades of data.
• Each lab result may have a linked review note-some
reviews may be for an entire lab visit, a specific panel, or a
single test result (whichever linkage is encoded in the
underlying data).
2. Synced & Bidirectional Review Notes:
• Beneath the table, display corresponding review notes.
• If the user scrolls horizontally or vertically in the table, the
review pane automatically syncs/highlights the note (s)
corresponding to the visible data.
• If the user clicks or hovers over a review note, the lab table
scrolls to and highlights the associated panel/column/test
(bidirectional).
• Mappings between labs and notes must be robust (e.g.,
via unique identifiers/dates in data structures).
3. Zoom/Focus Interaction:
• User can "zoom out" to display large time-chunks (e.g., 10
years and see all review notes for that interval.
• User can "zoom in" to see a single visit, day, or test panel
—and only the review(s) specific to that.
• Ul updates both table and review pane to reflect the
current zoom focus level.
4. Review Note Management:
• Users can add, edit, or (soft-) delete review notes.
• All edits, appends, or deletes must be timestamped/audit-
trailed and displayed inline (to meet HIPAA compliance).
• Deleted notes should remain visible as struck-through or
archived, with user ID/timestamp.
5. Performance & Extendability:
• Use virtualization, chunk loading, or other best practices
to maintain smooth UX even with decades of data.
• Design for desktop, with an eventual goal to refactor for
mobile/tablet.
• Use styling, CSS, or a Ul library for clear hover/click
highlighting across both panes (labs and notes).
Ensure accessibility best practices are observed.

NOTES: Do not build a new lab results matrix. I want you to improve our existing lab results matrix with the above vision. 

This is highly complex and I want to make sure you understand my vision before you implement. Ask me any clarifying questions you need and then create a mockup and clear explanation of what you intend to produce BEFORE BEGINNING ANY ACTUAL WORK. Also please consider scaffolding this project so that we can approach one feature at a time (if necessary).
