About me/personal story: 
I want to create a robust “about us” page but I’m not sure how to go about it. Here is my train of thought though, reorganize it however you think is best for a professional (about me): I want to maintain some privacy while also sharing some personal insight about the website. I have a good headshot if that is helpful. I started my journey in medicine as a scribe while working in college. I worked at multiple emergency rooms documenting everything that happened from start to finish for a patient’s journey through the ER. This exposure helped me pay for college expenses and gave me experience I needed to help get into medical school. years later,  I am family medicine physician in Hillsboro, Texas practicing rural medicine here for the past 7 years (total 10 years in practice if you include residency…10 years sounds better in my opinion). I simply hate documenting. It takes all the joy out of medicine. For decades we, as physicians, have dealt with these dinosaur-like EMRs that are living in the dark ages. They were obviously designed by developers/coders from the mid-90s and do not seem to have been updated on any architectural level since then. They also seem to have been developed for the purpose of the insurance companies at the cost of the physicians. AI came along VERY recently and not a single person out there (before me) has created an EMR from the ground-up based exclusively on AI. A couple years ago I came across some fantastic tools (otter, specifically but others as well) that were able to record my voice and other’s voices and come up with a summary of the meeting. After using otter for a few months (and being incredibly impressed with it) it occurred to me there must be a similar tool available specifically geared toward physicians/providers to help document their notes. I did some searching and came across Freed. Freed was a life-changer for me as it allowed me to simply talk to my patients and AI would write the note. It has saved me hundreds of hours over the past 18 months. Another tool is HARPA. HARPA is an Ai extension that I have been using for about the same period of time that helps me summarize notes, create histories and physicals in the hospital, discharge summaries, and many others. As I mentioned, I’m a rural family physician so I work in the clinic seeing 20-30 patients per day AND I work in the hospital seeing my patients and taking call for the hospital, AND I deliver babies and perform c-sections, AND I perform endoscopies like colonoscopy and EGD. These various AI tools have been absolutely critical to my ability to focus on patient care while producing excellent documentation. In fact, since I started using all of these tools consistently, I’ve received considerable positive feedback from colleagues who noticed my good documentation “skills”. That’s when I realized that we, as physicians, deserve more. For far too long we have labored and been burdened as documentation specialists. We have accepted this burden out of duty to our patients as a means to help improve communication in the healthcare field. After all, as we are taught from day 1 “If you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen”. There is good reason for this logic, but the core message that all physicians here in their heart is the same: you aren’t good enough unless your documentation proves it. Over the past 15 years I have personally seen the evolution of technology from paper charts to typing and to dictation. Each step along the way merely allowed doctors to create better medical records (that’s a good thing) but none of it did anything to remove the burden of that documentation. In other words, the documentation improved but the burden remained unchanged and in many aspects, it worsened. Until this point in history, technology has only been able to improve the documentation without lightening the burden. BUT NOW THAT IS ALL CHANGING. AI has ushered in a new era and a vastly improved landscape for technology, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF DOCUMENTATION, and even MORE SO, documentation for clinicians. LLMs are incredibly well suited for parsing information from documents (see our attachment module), determining relevant information from irrelevant information from patient conversation, and it’s only getting better. Even a few months from now, imagine how much better our system will be. I saw this happening in real time and decided that physicians and patients deserve so much better than what the market offered. AI scribes are a dime a dozen but all they do is write the SOAP note (and sometimes a few other things). EMRs are…well more than a DIME a dozen but they are everywhere! ANd they are all based on archaic legacy technology that is slow to improve. Even the best ones are simply “stapling” AI to their product. Not a single one is restructuring from the ground up. But I am. That’s what Clarafi is. It’s a ground-up AI based complete restructuring of the EMR ecosystem. AI scribe, yes. But so much more. Why stop at the SOAP note? Orders show up automatically, too. Billing codes, helll even the ENTIRE MEDICAL CHART gets updated automatically. But we’re just getting started. The goal is simple: get medicine back to medicine. Nothing needs to be fragmented. It can be “Clarafied”. 
-Misc about me to fit in there somewhere: the name Clarafi is named in honor/memory of my grandmother Clara. She died at the age of 103 only a few months ago, in this midst of the creation of this EMR. She was an RN and the matriarch of my family, whom I love dearly. 
-I have a beloved wife and 5 children. 
-I live and work in a small town and I absolutely love what I do, every day.
