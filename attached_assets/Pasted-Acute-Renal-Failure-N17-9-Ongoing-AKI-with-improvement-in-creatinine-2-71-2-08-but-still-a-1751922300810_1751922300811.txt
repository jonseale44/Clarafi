Acute Renal Failure (N17.9)

•	Ongoing AKI with improvement in creatinine (2.71 → 2.08), but still above baseline.

•	Continue IV NS fluids and monitor renal function.

Hyponatremia (E87.1)

•	Chronic, now improving hyponatremia (119 → 129); gradual sodium correction.

•	Continue slow correction with IV NS, monitor sodium closely.

New Onset Atrial Fibrillation (I48.91)

•	Prior irregularly irregular rhythm, now normal rate/rhythm on exam; CHA2DS2-VASc = 1.

•	Continue monitoring cardiac rhythm, no anticoagulation indicated at this time.

Urinary Retention (R33.9)

•	Significant retention after Foley removal, unable to void, no urge to urinate.

•	Reinsert Foley catheter for retention and monitor for post-obstructive diuresis.

Urinary Tract Infection (N39.0)

•	UTI with improved but persistent leukocytosis; on ceftriaxone IV, culture results pending.

•	Continue IV ceftriaxone, adjust therapy per sensitivity if culture results available.

Generalized Weakness, Recurrent Falls (R53.1)

•	Persistent fatigue and confusion, ongoing fall risk due to weakness and electrolyte issues.

•	Maintain fall precautions and continue PT/OT therapy.

Morbid Obesity (E66.01)

•	Obesity (BMI >40), ongoing risk for hospitalization complications.

•	Continue nutritional consult and weight management counseling.

Chronic Back Pain (M54.5)

•	Chronic pain and instability, likely contributing to falls and debility.

•	Continue pain management (avoid NSAIDs due to renal impairment), monitor pain.

Electrolyte Imbalance: Hypokalemia (E87.6)

•	Persistent hypokalemia despite repletion (K 3.2).

•	Continue oral KCl supplementation, monitor potassium and adjust dose as needed.

Hydronephrosis and Hydroureter (N13.39)

•	Left-sided hydronephrosis/hydroureter seen on imaging, related to outlet obstruction with retention.

•	Monitor for signs of worsening obstruction or infection, reassess after resolution of retention.

Anemia, chronic (D64.9)

•	Chronic normocytic anemia (Hgb 10.6), stable, likely multifactorial.

•	Monitor CBC, no transfusion indicated.
