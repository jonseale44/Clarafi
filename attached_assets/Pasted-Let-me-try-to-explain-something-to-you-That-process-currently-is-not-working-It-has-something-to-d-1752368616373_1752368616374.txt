Let me try to explain something to you. That process currently is not working. It has something to do with the database (see errors). There is a future iteration of this program that has attempted to fix the database to align it with the schema somehow, but it has resulted in two main problems: 1) duplicating the medications within the medication section and 2) this medications within the medication section never show up as “pended”, only as active. DO NOT MAKE ANY CODE CHANGES. Evaluate our code and help me explain to this “future” AI agent what we might have done wrong attempting to fix it.

Diagnosed potential database schema issues (11 seconds)
Looking at the medication workflow code, I can help explain what might have gone wrong when attempting to fix the database schema alignment. Here's my analysis:

Potential Database Schema Issues That Could Cause These Problems:
1. Duplicate Medications Problem
The duplication issue likely stems from:

Missing or broken foreign key constraints between the orders and medications tables. The workflow depends on referenceId in orders linking to medication IDs.
Schema migration that changed the relationship between orders and medications from one-to-one to one-to-many (or vice versa)
Missing unique constraints that should prevent duplicate medications from being created for the same order
Broken cascade rules - if medications are created both when orders are created AND when they're signed, without proper deduplication
2. "Pending" Status Never Appearing Problem
This suggests several possible schema issues:

Default value changed - The medications table might have a default status of 'active' instead of 'pending'
Trigger or constraint that automatically sets status to 'active' on insert
Missing status enum values - The database might not recognize 'pending' as a valid status
Broken workflow linkage - The connection between order status ('draft', 'signed') and medication status ('pending', 'active') might be severed
Key Database Relationships That Must Be Preserved:
Order → Medication Reference:

Orders have referenceId that points to medications
This linkage is critical for the signing workflow
Status Synchronization:

Draft orders should create 'pending' medications
Signed orders should activate medications
The medicationDelta.signMedicationOrders() function depends on this
Audit Trail:

The visitHistory and changeLog fields track medication changes
If these are missing or malformed, the system can't track state transitions
What Likely Went Wrong:
The future AI agent probably tried to "align" the schema by:

Adding missing columns or constraints
Changing data types or default values
Modifying relationships between tables
Running migrations that didn't account for the complex order-to-medication workflow
This broke the delicate state machine that manages medication lifecycle from order creation → pending medication → signed order → active medication.

The fix attempt likely focused on structural alignment without understanding the business logic that depends on these specific database behaviors.
