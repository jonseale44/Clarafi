Certainly! You want to collaborate with the Replit Agent to diagnose and cure the source of the database/table sync/migration problem during deployment. Here’s what you should copy-paste for your agent:

Diagnostic & Solution Request for Replit Agent
Hi Agent,

I'm trying to deploy my app and encountering issues where Replit's deployment system thinks tables like marketing_automations, marketing_campaigns, marketing_insights, marketing_metrics, conversion_events, and user_acquisition are absent and prompts to create them, even though I see them in my production database using psql. The same applies to new columns on the users table (baa_accepted, etc.).

What I Need
I want to diagnose and solve the root of this table sync/migration drift problem.
Please do not just auto-create tables—I want to understand why Replit's migration system is out of sync with my checked (psql) working database.
Context
The tables exist and are present in my schema file.
My migrations may have run in production, but Replit's dev/preview environment keeps seeing the tables and columns as "missing".
All affected tables and column names match—no renames.
This causes failed deployments and warnings on each push.
Specific Questions/Actions:
What database URL does the Replit deploy preview use?

Is it different from my psql/production DB?
How can I view/change/confirm which DB is being migrated against?
How does Replit determine which migrations to run or not run?

Is there a migration history table or state file that controls this?
How can I safely synchronize the Replit dev/preview DB to match my production DB schema?

Should I re-apply all migrations, reset the dev DB, or import schema from production?
Is there a clean way to do this without data loss?
If there’s an init/reseed workflow, please describe it.
How can I ensure future schema changes (in Drizzle/Prisma or SQL) are applied in both Replit and production, so this doesn’t happen again?

Is there anything I can automate or a best practice I should follow?
If you want to suggest a fix, please be explicit and list out the exact steps or commands.

(For example: “Set DATABASE_URL to ___”, or “Run drizzle-kit push --force”, etc.)

In short: Please help me find and fix the underlying mismatch so that deployments and migrations work cleanly and reliably on both my dev (Replit) and production environments.
