Without making any changes (only discussing and evaluating and planning first), I want to work on the medications section of the chart. Now that we have a good arrangement for the medical problems section, I’d like to build out the medications next. First I want you to thoroughly study and understand how the medical problems section is arranged. There is the ability for users to add medical problems but also a connection from the encounter, in which GPT can automatically update medical problems (intelligently) at the end of the recording. While we discuss building this, there are some critical factors to remember. 1. First, this is an EMR and not just a documentation assistant. The medications section will need to contain real and validated medications and doses. There will be historical and current medications. My vision is to have this section connect automatically and intelligently to outside sources like pharmacies and other EMRs. So each medication will need to be standardized in some way. Again, think about this like a normal EMR and follow standards and practices you know about (think Athena and Epic). 2. Secondly, GPT is going to be the brain for making any medical decisions. YOu are not to introduce any frontend logic or regex patterns that make medical decisions. Rather, GPT should be prompted to do so. The medications will need to be able to be arranged by organ system or medical problem in a human-intuitive way or (optionally) alphabetically if the user desires. How the medications are arranged will be up to GPT. GPT will have access to the patient’s medical chart and can more intelligently arrange medication that are related to each other (insulin with metformin, lisinopril with amlodipine, etc.). 3. Speed is critical. When we consider the relationship of the SOAP note/encounter to the medical problems and the medications, we need to remember that a LOT is happening when the recording ends. I don’t want this to be very time consuming, so it might involve running GPT in parallel in some way or another. I’m not sure. But I want it to be fast. Now, let’s brainstorm and I’ll let you ask questions for clarification before we start working on it.
