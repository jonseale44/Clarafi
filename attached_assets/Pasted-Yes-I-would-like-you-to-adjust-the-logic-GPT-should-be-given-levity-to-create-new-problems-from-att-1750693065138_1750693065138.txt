Yes I would like you to adjust the logic. GPT should be given levity to create new problems from attachments if and when new problems are not in the chart already. Carefully examine the current functionality of the flow between SOAp notes and the medical problems and you will hopefully see that GPT can generate new problems via that flow. While I'm asking you to understand that flow, I'm NOT asking you to duplicate it in the attachment flow. The reason for this is simple, anything that gets uploaded as an attachment is, by definition, historical. It will be historical records, H&Ps, problem lists, etc. Let’s walk through the prior example with diabetes again. Suppose a patient is seen in the office for follow up of the DM2 with neuropathy E11.40. During the encounter/SOAP note, nothing changes about the plan or diagnosis, so the visit history for that encounter is straightforward something like “continue current regimen, check A1c today”. Suppose later that day the provider uploads some old medical chart records for that particular patient, back before the patient had developed neuropathy. His problem list would show DM2 E11.9. At this point, it would be detrimental to change the diagnosis from E11.40 down to E11.9. On the other hand, there might be new and valuable information present in the records/attachments such as additional diagnoses the provider didn’t know about (e.g. CHF, HTN), that should definitely be added to the chart. Moreover, attachment GPT should be given the levity to combine old diagnoses present in the attachment problem list if and when it deems it appropriate, but only for adding new diagnoses. For example, historical records may have a messy problem list that shows separate entries for DM2 (E11.9) and diabetic polyneuropathy (G63.2) in historical records should, where supported, be reconciled to the more precise E11.40 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy). The same principle applies to other commonly paired conditions, like hypertension with CKD (I12.9) or hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0). The attachment GPT can add new diagnoses but only the SOAP GPT should update/combine these diagnoses. Regardless, the visit history always needs to carry forward. All of this is very complex, which is why GPT is exclusively responsible for it, but we need to make sure we’re prompting it to be aware of its responsibility. I know this is a lot to chew on. REview my message and let me know what you think. I want to verify you understand it before you make any changes. Please ask me any clarifying questions you want.
