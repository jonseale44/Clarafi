- Respiratory: Lung auscultation reveals crackles suggestive of pneumonia.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Pneumonia, unspecified organism (J18.9): 
- Clinical presentation and lung auscultation suggest pneumonia. Awaiting chest X-ray for confirmation.

2. Asthma with acute exacerbation (J45.901): 
- Worsening breathlessness and cough indicate an exacerbation. Albuterol inhaler is not providing relief.

3. Essential hypertension (I10): 
- Patient reports running out of lisinopril. Blood pressure control needs reassessment.

4. Tobacco use disorder (F17.200): 
- Contributing factor to respiratory symptoms. Smoking cessation advised.

5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified (J44.9): 
- Consideration given the smoking history and respiratory symptoms.

---

PLAN:
1. Pneumonia: 
- Prescribe Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days (considering penicillin allergy). 
- Order chest X-ray today to confirm diagnosis.

2. Asthma Exacerbation: 
- Continue albuterol inhaler as needed. 
- Consider adding a corticosteroid inhaler if symptoms persist.

3. Hypertension: 
- Refill lisinopril 10 mg daily. 
- Monitor blood pressure at home and follow up in two weeks.

4. Tobacco Use Disorder: 
- Discuss smoking cessation strategies and offer resources/support.

5. Follow-Up Instructions: 
- Return for follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. 
- Repeat CBC to monitor eosinophil levels.

6. Patient Education: 
- Educate on the importance of medication adherence and smoking cessation.
