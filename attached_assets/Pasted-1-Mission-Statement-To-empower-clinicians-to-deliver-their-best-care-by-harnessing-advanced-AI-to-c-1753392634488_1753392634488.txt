6. Personal Story / “Why Clarafi?”
The name Clarafi was inspired by grandmother Clara, RN from the greatest generation, and is dedicated in her (to her??) memory. After years of losing hours to documentation, I built Clarafi to help every clinician spend more time with patients and less time with paperwork—while actually improving quality of care.



After years struggling to balance charting with real patient care, I knew medicine could be better. Clarafi isn’t here just to save you time—it’s designed to help you rediscover your purpose, improve your practice, and reconnect with why you became a clinician in the first place.
