Social History:

Following a similar logic as we use in the unified medical problems parser and past surgical history (which successfully extract information from attachments and encounter notes to create comprehensive problem and surgical history lists), I’d like us to shift our attention to a comparable function focused on social history. It's crucial to remember we are developing for a production-level EMR, which must be designed to meet or exceed standards of care expected of top EMRs like Athena or Epic. Accordingly, we need to consider industry standards for required social history data, such as tobacco use, alcohol use, recreational drug use, occupational exposures, living situation, sexual history, and more.

Just as in the medical and surgical history modules, it must provide the ability to extract and update social history automatically from attachments and encounter documentation, as well as allow users to update and enter social history elements manually. Let’s brainstorm on how this should work, with no code changes yet—just high-level design questions and considerations.

Some initial considerations include data structuring and managing incremental updates or corrections. In the medical problems and surgical history lists, we have a mechanism for intelligently updating and consolidating entries, especially as new, more accurate information becomes available and to ensure continuity across visits. For example, social history changes over time (e.g., a patient who previously reported "current smoker" may later report quitting). The system should be able to reflect the most current, accurate information while maintaining an appropriate audit trail for what was true at each visit, but avoid displaying outdated/conflicting information simultaneously unless clinically relevant.

Suppose, for instance, in one encounter, an attachment or note says "patient smokes half a pack per day (current)", which the system adds as "smoker" in the social history. In a later encounter, it’s documented that the patient quit smoking a month ago. Both the original and updated social history statements are important in context, but the system should intelligently update/consolidate so that only the most accurate, up-to-date information is reflected going forward, ideally with past details appropriately logged.

I want you to closely examine how medical and surgical histories currently work and use them as models as we brainstorm the requirements for social history. Do not propose code changes (yet)—let’s stick to conceptual design for now. Please ask any clarifying questions you have about my vision for implementing this feature.
