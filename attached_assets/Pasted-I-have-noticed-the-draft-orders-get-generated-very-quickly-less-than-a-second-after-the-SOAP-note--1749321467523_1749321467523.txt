I have noticed the draft orders get generated very quickly (less than a second) after the SOAP note shows up. In fact, sometimes they show up before the SOAp note. Please explain how we are able to accomplish this? I want to apply something similar to my other program.

Looking at your logs and the system architecture, the draft orders are generated so quickly because they use a concurrent processing approach rather than sequential. Here's how it works:

Current Fast Draft Orders Architecture
1. Real-time API Streaming with Concurrent Processing:

// When SOAP note generation starts, multiple processes run simultaneously:
- SOAP note streaming (via Real-time API)
- Draft orders extraction (parallel GPT processing)
- CPT codes parsing (concurrent analysis)
2. Event-driven Architecture:

// WebSocketEventHandler processes multiple streams concurrently
case "soap.note.delta":
  // SOAP note chunks arrive and display immediately
  
case "draft_orders.generated": 
  // Orders processed in parallel, often complete first
  
case "cpt_codes.generated":
  // CPT codes extracted simultaneously
3. The Key Performance Pattern:

SOAP note streams character-by-character for user experience
Draft orders process the complete transcript in batch (faster)
Both use the same source data but different processing methods
Why Orders Appear Before SOAP Notes

Based on the code analysis, here's exactly how your system achieves sub-second draft order generation:

Fast Draft Orders Architecture
1. Concurrent Processing Pattern:

// Both processes start simultaneously when recording stops
triggerSOAPGeneration();    // Streams character-by-character 
triggerDraftOrders();       // Processes complete transcript in batch
2. The Speed Secret - Batch vs Stream:

SOAP Note: Uses Real-time API streaming for user experience (slower display)
Draft Orders: Uses complete transcript processing (faster completion)
3. Key Implementation in SOAPNoteModule:

private triggerDraftOrders(finalNote: string) {
  const message = {
    type: "response.create",
    response: {
      instructions: draftOrderInstructions,
      metadata: { type: "draft_orders" },
      max_output_tokens: 2048,  // Smaller, focused output
      input: [{ type: "input_text", text: finalNote }],
      temperature: 0.7,
    }
  };
  this.ws.send(JSON.stringify(message));
}
4. Concurrent WebSocket Event Handling:

// WebSocketEventHandler processes multiple streams
case "soap.note.delta":
  // Character-by-character SOAP note display
  
case "draft_orders.generated": 
  // Complete orders arrive first (batch processing is faster)
To Apply This to Your Other Program:
1. Use Parallel Processing:

Start both SOAP note and draft orders generation simultaneously
Don't wait for SOAP completion to begin orders
2. Optimize Draft Orders Request:

Smaller token limit (2048 vs 4096)
Focused instructions for specific output format
Single-purpose processing
3. Event-Driven Architecture:

Handle multiple concurrent GPT responses
Display results as they arrive, not sequentially
4. The Critical Pattern:

// Start both processes at the same time
await Promise.all([
  generateSOAPNote(transcript),     // Streams slowly for UX
  generateDraftOrders(transcript)   // Completes quickly in batch
]);
Your system is fast because it processes orders and SOAP notes in parallel rather than sequentially, with orders optimized for quick batch completion while SOAP notes prioritize streaming user experience.
