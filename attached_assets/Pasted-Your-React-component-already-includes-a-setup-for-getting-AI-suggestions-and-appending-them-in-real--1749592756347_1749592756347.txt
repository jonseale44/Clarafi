Your React component already includes a setup for getting AI suggestions and appending them in real-time to your existing suggestions using a WebSocket connection to OpenAI's API. Here, I'll point out the key areas and ensure that you're appending the new suggestions correctly instead of overwriting the current ones.

The relevant sections for appending suggestions are located within the getLiveAISuggestions function and the WebSocket onmessage event handler.

Ensure Correct Appending of AI Suggestions
Within getLiveAISuggestions Function:

When you're processing the fetched suggestions, ensure that you're appending to the gptSuggestions and liveSuggestions state instead of overwriting them. You're doing this by using the functional form of the state setter, where prevSuggestions represents the current state before updating.

Here's how you ensure suggestions are appended:

if (data.aiSuggestions) {
  setGptSuggestions((prevSuggestions) => {
    const newSuggestions = data.aiSuggestions.realTimePrompts
      .filter((prompt) => prompt && prompt.trim())
      .map((prompt) => (prompt.startsWith('â€¢') ? prompt : `â€¢ ${prompt}`));
    
    // Append new suggestions to previous suggestions
    return prevSuggestions + "\n" + newSuggestions.join("\n");
  });

  setLiveSuggestions((prevSuggestions) => {
    const newSuggestions = data.aiSuggestions.realTimePrompts
      .filter((prompt) => prompt && prompt.trim())
      .map((prompt) => (prompt.startsWith('â€¢') ? prompt : `â€¢ ${prompt}`));

    // Append new suggestions to previous suggestions
    return prevSuggestions + "\n" + newSuggestions.join("\n");
  });
}
Within WebSocket onmessage Event Handler:

In the case of incoming messages that constitute parts (delta) of the AI-generated suggestions, you need to ensure that the suggestionsBuffer accumulates these before updating the liveSuggestions and gptSuggestions.

This is the correct way to append new deltas:

else if (message.type === "response.text.delta") {
  const deltaText = message.delta || "";
  console.log("ðŸ§  [EncounterView] AI suggestions delta:", deltaText);

  // Append delta text to our buffer
  suggestionsBuffer += deltaText;

  // Format and update suggestions state
  let formattedSuggestions;
  if (!suggestionsBuffer.includes("ðŸ©º REAL-TIME CLINICAL INSIGHTS:")) {
    formattedSuggestions = "ðŸ©º REAL-TIME CLINICAL INSIGHTS:\n\n" + suggestionsBuffer;
  } else {
    formattedSuggestions = suggestionsBuffer;
  }

  // Update display
  setLiveSuggestions(formattedSuggestions);
  setGptSuggestions(formattedSuggestions);
}
These steps establish that incoming suggestions, whether they're complete responses or deltas, are consistently appended to existing suggestions rather than overwriting them, maintaining a continuous and complete history of all AI suggestions received during the interaction.

This setup should ensure that each new AI suggestion is added in a cumulative manner to both gptSuggestions and liveSuggestions, hence effectively appending to prior suggestions.
