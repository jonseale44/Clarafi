Medical Draft Orders Processing System Architecture Guide
Overview for Implementation
You are building an AI-powered medical draft orders system that automatically extracts and processes medication orders, lab test orders, and imaging orders from clinical text (like SOAP notes or voice transcriptions). The system parses unstructured medical text and creates structured, actionable orders for healthcare providers to review and approve.

System Architecture
Frontend Order Processing Module
DraftOrdersModule (external_DraftOrdersModule.ts)

Core client-side parsing engine that extracts orders from clinical text
Handles three order types: medications, lab tests, and imaging studies
Uses regex patterns and natural language processing to identify order sections
Provides real-time parsing and validation of extracted orders
Integrates with patient chart data for context-aware processing
Order Processing Methods:

parseMedication(): Extracts medication name, dosage, frequency, quantity, refills
parseLab(): Identifies lab test names, priority levels, and clinical context
parseImaging(): Processes imaging study types and urgency requirements
parseOrdersFromText(): Main orchestrator that identifies and categorizes all order types
Backend API Layer
Orders Routes (external_orders.ts)

REST endpoints for order creation and management
POST /api/orders/draft/batch: Creates multiple orders simultaneously
POST /api/orders: Single order creation endpoint
Handles data validation and database schema mapping
Integrates with lab order templates for standardized processing
Database Operations (external_crud.ts)

createOrder(): Inserts new orders into the database
Handles order type-specific field validation
Manages relationships with patients and providers
Tracks order status progression (draft → pending → approved)
Frontend Order Management Interface
DraftOrders Component (external_DraftOrders.tsx)

User interface for reviewing and managing extracted orders
Displays parsed orders in categorized sections (medications, labs, imaging)
Provides manual editing capabilities for order details
Handles batch saving and error management
Shows real-time parsing results from voice transcriptions
Data Processing Flow
Text Input: Clinical text from voice transcription or manual entry
Pattern Recognition: Module identifies order sections using medical terminology
Data Extraction: Parse specific order details (medication names, dosages, lab tests)
Validation: Check for required fields and medical coding standards
Database Storage: Save as draft orders for provider review
Provider Review: Healthcare staff can edit, approve, or reject orders
Order Type Processing
Medication Orders:

Extract: medication name, strength, dosage form, quantity, refills, SIG instructions
Validate: drug name recognition, dosage appropriateness, interaction checks
Default values: 30-day supply, 0 refills, tablet form
Lab Test Orders:

Extract: test names, priority level (STAT vs routine), clinical indication
Map to standardized lab templates and CPT codes
Handle common abbreviations (CBC, CMP, TSH, etc.)
Imaging Orders:

Extract: study type, body part, clinical indication, urgency
Support modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound
Priority classification for scheduling
Integration Points
Voice Workflow Integration:

Receives parsed text from voice transcription modules
Processes orders in real-time during clinical encounters
Updates patient charts with new orders automatically
Clinical Decision Support:

Cross-references patient allergies and current medications
Suggests appropriate lab tests based on diagnoses
Flags potential drug interactions or contraindications
Error Handling and Validation
Input Validation:

Required field checking for each order type
Medical terminology validation against standard references
Patient-specific safety checks (allergies, contraindications)
Batch Processing:

Handles multiple orders simultaneously with rollback capabilities
Provides detailed error reporting for failed order creation
Maintains data integrity across related orders
Security and Compliance
HIPAA-compliant order processing and storage
Audit trails for all order modifications
Provider authentication for order approval
Patient consent verification for medication orders
This architecture enables healthcare providers to dictate clinical notes and have the system automatically extract actionable orders, significantly reducing manual data entry while maintaining clinical accuracy and safety standards.
