Do not make any changes to the program yet. Just review and report and we will discuss. Keep in mind this is a normal full-scope EMR so we need to achieve or exceed the standards of production level clinic-based EMRs like Epic and Athena. First, take a careful look at our code regarding SOAP note generation within the provider encounter view. We use a complex REST API GPT programmed to generate a SOAP note in a particular manner with particular formatting, wording, spacing, etc. Without making any changes yet (simply brainstorming here!), let’s discuss ways to incorporate different preferences for note style. What I imagined in the UI would be to have a series of drop-down menus for different types of notes. Progress note would be one category which would include our current SOAP note, but additionally the APSO note (assessment and plan are first, then subjective and objective), a hospital progress note, a more narrative SOAP note, and so on. Next category of notes could be History and Physical. Another category could be Discharge summary. Another category could be Procedure notes. Don’t worry about those details just yet because that’s the easy part. The hard part is to incorporate our CURRENT Rest Api GPT design to be able to handle switching flawlessly between note types DURING THE RECORDING. In my imagination, this would involve creating a whole series of GPT prompts for each note. We already have one for the current SOAP note (line 445 in routes.ts). Next we can do “APSO”, and so on. The trick we need to brainstorm is how to fit this vision within our current code. Perhaps we can make changes within routes.ts so that whatever manual function the user selects will trigger routes.ts to redirect to the appropriate prompt, which will still generate the note and put it back into the same UI location. The main concern I have is that there are currently MANY connections TO AND FROM the SOAP note currently. I don’t like the idea of having to painstakingly identify every single little thing to and from the SOAP note and copy it into each and every new note route. Moreover, what if I decide to add more connections to the SOAP note some day? I’ll have to do that for each and every template we create. Consider our options and the current codebase and let me know what you think. Be mindful of the lurking legacy files and technical debt that might distract you. Do not make any changes, just evaluate and let me know what you think and we can keep brainstorming.
