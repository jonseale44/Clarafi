SEO
-Now I want to focus on SEO optimization. i want to fully utilize GPT to our advantage here. Let’s brainstorm options here. We can create a blog page that gets GPT to write a blog post or article every few days regarding a topic that our potential users would find interesting. But don’t stop there. What other SEO optimization strategies can you think of? Let’s brainstorm and come up with some. Don’t make any code changes yet, just evaluate our EMR and its purpose, and think of some ways we can implement this (in an automated fashion). 

Yes, begin with the blog system. Create a TODO list for other items. Keep in mind that the blog system (or is it articles? is there a difference) needs to be articles that are created by GPT but reviewed by me. I don’t want any blogs being generated that I don’t review first. Part of the creation of these articles should be a a review and correction process by myself. YOu can create it so that when I sign in as system admin there will be articles available for me to review and critique. Then GPT can make the edits, then I can press “publish”. Before you  begin work on this, what questions do you have about my vision? 

-The automated, regular blogs should be predefined categories but I would like the ability to sometimes request an article on a particular subject. The categories should be focused on the population of our desired users which are primarily physicians but sometimes clinical administrators and CEOs. 
-Generate approximately 3 articles per week. 
-The system should automatically research and integrate trending healthcare/EMR keywords. As much as possible, we should keep it recent. Can we search the internet for news, information, etc? Focus primarily on beating the competition, and don’t be afraid to include the names of competitors. Occasionally, even, a comparison list between our system and theirs. 
-Additionally, we need to make sure nothing that GPT generates is plagiarized. Is there a way to implement a plagiarism check on its content? 
-I think “Clarafi Team” is good. I would prefer NOT to use “AI disclosure” if we don’t have to. 
-Definitely diagrams and infographics are fantastic if they are accurate. Screenshots from the EMR would be great, if relevant. 
-I am completely in favor a comments section (assuming I can control that to some extent). Also in favor (big time) of social sharing buttons. We need to connect our website to as many other legitimate websites as possible. I have no problem at all with newsletter signup integration but we’ll have to set that up as well. If related articles help us to connect to other websites (for the SEO benefits), then I’m also for that. 
-I do want to be able to edit directly in the editor, but I also want to just be able to message GPT to “change this section” or something like that. Or “remove this comment”. I don’t think I need version history/track changes. Yes there should be a preview mode before publishing. 
-Yes, the blog should be public access.
