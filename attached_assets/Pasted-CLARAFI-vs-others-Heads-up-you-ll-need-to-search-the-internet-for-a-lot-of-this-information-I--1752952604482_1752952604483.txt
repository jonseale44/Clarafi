CLARAFI vs others:
-Heads up, you’ll need to search the internet for a lot of this information. 
-I want you to create a detailed report of our capabilities as an AI scribe compared with other AI scribes out there (freed, Heidi, Deepscribe, Abridge, Nabla, ScribeHealth AI, Augmedix, Suki, Omni MD). Mention every single one of our capabilities for a Tier 1 customer, and explain each one in detail. This will be in paragraph format at first and then as a comparison chart with check marks for Clarafi and either check marks or X marks for the other systems. 
-I want a concise but descriptive explanation of ALL of our features (some listed below). This should be phrased in a way that can be easily understood by our users (mostly doctors, sometimes clinical administrators). 
-The format should be first written word and toward the end include the table with checks and x’s. Feel free to make the whole article as long as you want. 
-The capabilities to mention include (but are not limited to): creating a summarized medical chart (problem list, medications, allergies, vitals, labs, surgical history, imaging, family history, etc) from simply uploading an attachment/medical record. 
-Also we have real-time Ai suggestions (describe what that entails) 
-Also we have live transcription while you speak (which will also translate other languages into english automatically). 
-Also we have the SOAP not that shows up LIVE and modifies itself DURING THE TRANSCRIPTION. 
-Also we have automatic order generation that shows up based on the transcription. 
-Also we have automatic CPT/billing code generation that shows up based on the transcription. 
-Also meds can be sorted by problem rather than just alphabetical (although alphabetical is available as well). 
-What else did I miss? 
-Oh right, we have note TEMPLATES (and more coming). Some others have this to, but it should be mentioned. 
-While you’re looking for all this, what things do OTHER scribes have that we do not? 

For tier 2, we also have electronic prescription (coming soon at least), faxing meds, ordering labs and imaging (all automatically). 
-Also for tier 2 we have automated lab results evaluation by Ai - reviewed by provider prior to being sent to patient. 
-Tier 2 also includes an intelligent scheduler that has the ability to predict future appointment duration and schedule accordingly (can be toggled off and manual input instead).
