# AWS App Runner Deployment Attempt - July 30, 2025

## Deployment Timeline

### 12:30 PM - Initial Issue Identified
- Existing App Runner service "clarafi-emr" stuck in deployment loop
- Application logs maxed out (100 log limit reached)
- Decision: Start fresh deployment from scratch

### 12:35 PM - Preparation Steps
1. Created `apprunner.yaml` configuration file:
   ```yaml
   version: 1.0
   runtime: nodejs-20
   build:
     commands:
       build:
         - npm install
         - npm run build
         - cp -r dist/public public
   run:
     runtime-version: latest
     command: npm start
     network:
       port: 8080
       env: PORT
     env:
       - name: NODE_ENV
         value: production
       - name: PORT
         value: "8080"
   ```

2. Verified build process:
   - Build creates `dist/index.js` (2.5mb) for backend
   - Build creates `dist/public/` folder with frontend assets
   - Added copy command to move public files to correct location

3. Pushed changes to GitHub (branch: main2)

### 12:45 PM - AWS App Runner Service Creation
1. Deleted old "clarafi-emr" service
2. Started creating new service:
   - Source: Source code repository ✓
   - Provider: GitHub ✓
   - Repository: Clarafi ✓
   - Branch: main2 ✓
   - Deployment trigger: Automatic ✓
   - Build configuration: Use configuration file (apprunner.yaml) ✓

### Current Status (1:18 PM) - BLOCKED
- On "Review and create" page
- Completed configurations:
  - Service name: clarafi-production ✓
  - Virtual CPU: 1 vCPU ✓
  - Virtual memory: 2 GB ✓
  - Health check: /api/health ✓
  - Security: Default IAM role ✓
  - Networking: Public endpoint ✓
  - Build: Using apprunner.yaml configuration file ✓
- **Key Finding**: Environment variables not available during creation when using configuration file
- **BLOCKED**: AWS Account 098819595270 temporarily restricted
  - Error: "Account 098819595270 is temporarily restricted"
  - Unable to create App Runner service
  - **Root Cause Found**: AWS credentials exposed in GitHub repository
  - File: `attached_assets/Pasted-Last-login-Tue-Jul-29...txt`
  - Required Actions:
    1. Remove exposed file from GitHub
    2. Rotate AWS access keys
    3. Contact AWS Support for restriction removal

## Key Configuration Notes

### Critical Environment Variables Required:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- `JWT_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- All API keys (OpenAI, Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio)

### Service Configuration:
- Name: clarafi-production
- CPU: 1 vCPU (for production performance)
- Memory: 2 GB (for production performance)
- Health check path: `/api/health`

### Previous Issues Resolved:
1. **Branch mismatch**: Now correctly using main2
2. **Missing config file**: Created apprunner.yaml
3. **Static file location**: Added copy command in build

## Next Steps:
1. Click "Next" on Configure build page
2. Configure service settings
3. Add all environment variables
4. Complete deployment
5. Monitor logs for successful startup
