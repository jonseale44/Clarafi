# Comprehensive EMR Mobile Migration Analysis

## Core Principle
The mobile app must have COMPLETE feature parity with the web EMR. This is NOT a simplified companion app.

## What Stays Exactly The Same (Backend/Logic)

### 1. Complete API Layer
- All 200+ API endpoints remain unchanged
- Authentication/session management
- WebSocket connections for voice
- All database operations
- Business logic and validations

### 2. Data Models & Types
- Complete schema.ts (all 50+ tables)
- All TypeScript interfaces
- Validation schemas
- Database relationships

### 3. Clinical Intelligence
- GPT-4 integration for all features
- Voice transcription pipeline
- SOAP note generation
- Natural language order parsing
- Clinical decision support
- All parser services

### 4. Core Services
- Patient management
- Encounter workflows
- Order processing
- Lab integration
- Document processing
- All background services

## What Needs Mobile UI Adaptation

### 1. Navigation Architecture
**Web**: Sidebar + top nav + breadcrumbs
**Mobile**: Bottom tab navigation + stack navigation
- Patient list → Patient detail → Encounter
- Dashboard → Quick actions
- Voice recording as floating action button

### 2. Chart Sections Display
**Web**: Multi-column accordions
**Mobile**: Full-screen sections with swipe navigation
- Medical Problems: Card-based list
- Medications: Expandable cards with actions
- Lab Results: Scrollable cards instead of matrix
- Vitals: Timeline view

### 3. Data Entry Patterns
**Web**: Large forms, modal dialogs
**Mobile**: Step-by-step wizards, bottom sheets
- Order entry: Full-screen with voice input prominent
- SOAP notes: Sectioned editing with voice-to-text
- Signatures: Touch-based signing

### 4. Complex Tables
**Web**: Dense data tables with sorting/filtering
**Mobile**: Card layouts with essential info + expand for details
- Lab results matrix → Grouped by date cards
- Appointment grid → List with visual indicators
- Order queue → Prioritized card stack

### 5. File Handling
**Web**: Drag-and-drop, multi-file upload
**Mobile**: Camera capture, gallery picker, document scanner
- Direct camera → OCR pipeline
- Native document scanning
- Photo library integration

## What Can Be Removed/Deferred

### 1. Multi-Window Features
- Side-by-side chart comparison
- Multiple patient tabs
- Floating panels

### 2. Desktop-Specific Interactions
- Hover tooltips → Long press
- Right-click menus → Swipe actions
- Keyboard shortcuts → Gesture navigation

### 3. Print-Specific Features
- Direct PDF printing → Share sheet
- Print preview → PDF generation for sharing
- Batch printing → Individual sharing

## Technical Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Fork Replit Expo template
2. Set up navigation structure
3. Migrate authentication flow
4. Connect to existing backend
5. Implement patient list/search

### Phase 2: Core Clinical Features (Week 2)
1. Voice recording/transcription
2. Encounter creation/management
3. SOAP note generation
4. Basic chart viewing (read-only)
5. Natural language orders

### Phase 3: Full Chart Management (Week 3)
1. All chart sections (CRUD)
2. Order management
3. Lab results viewing
4. Medication management
5. Document/image capture

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
1. Multi-provider workflows
2. Offline capability
3. Push notifications
4. Background sync
5. Performance optimization

## Mobile-Specific Enhancements

### 1. Native Capabilities
- Biometric authentication
- Push notifications for critical labs
- Background voice recording
- Offline mode with sync
- Native camera with OCR

### 2. Mobile UX Patterns
- Pull-to-refresh everywhere
- Swipe actions (archive, delete)
- Bottom sheets for quick actions
- Floating action buttons
- Gesture navigation

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading chart sections
- Image compression
- Cached API responses
- Optimistic updates
- Background prefetching

## Architecture Decision

### Recommended Approach: Native React Native
- Use Expo for development ease
- Share 90% of business logic
- Native performance for voice recording
- Access to all device APIs
- Single codebase for iOS/Android

### Alternative Considered: PWA
- Pros: Same codebase as web
- Cons: Limited native features, voice recording issues
- Verdict: Not suitable for full EMR

## File Structure Plan

```
clarafi-mobile/
├── src/
│   ├── screens/          # Full-screen views
│   ├── navigation/       # React Navigation setup
│   ├── components/       # Reusable mobile components
│   ├── services/         # Shared with web (API, auth)
│   ├── hooks/           # React hooks (some shared)
│   ├── utils/           # Helpers (mostly shared)
│   └── types/           # TypeScript (100% shared)
├── assets/              # Mobile-specific assets
└── app.json            # Expo configuration
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Feature Parity**: Every feature available on web works on mobile
2. **Performance**: Voice recording and transcription work flawlessly
3. **Native Feel**: Follows iOS/Android design guidelines
4. **Offline Support**: Critical features work without connection
5. **Efficiency**: Optimized for one-handed use during patient care

## Next Steps

1. Fork official Replit Expo template
2. Set up proper project structure
3. Migrate core services and types
4. Build navigation skeleton
5. Implement features methodically by phase
