# Medical Problems Ranking System Documentation

## Overview
The medical problems ranking system uses GPT-4.1 artificial intelligence to assign intelligent clinical priority rankings to every medical condition in a patient's problem list. This creates a dynamic, patient-specific prioritization that helps healthcare providers focus on the most clinically significant conditions.

## Ranking Scale
- **Range**: 1.00 (highest priority) to 99.99 (lowest priority)
- **Precision**: Decimal precision prevents ranking ties
- **Direction**: Lower numbers = higher clinical priority

## Core Ranking Factors

### 1. Clinical Severity & Immediacy (Primary Factor)
**Weight**: Highest influence on ranking

**Categories**:
- **Life-threatening conditions: 1.00-10.00**
  - Examples: Acute MI (1.50), stroke, acute renal failure, sepsis
  - Requires immediate intervention and monitoring

- **Urgent conditions requiring monitoring: 10.01-20.00**
  - Examples: Uncontrolled diabetes with neuropathy (15.25), severe HTN, heart failure exacerbation
  - Active management needed to prevent complications

- **Chronic conditions requiring active management: 20.01-40.00**
  - Examples: Controlled diabetes, stable CAD, CKD stages 3-4
  - Ongoing medication adjustments and regular monitoring

- **Stable chronic conditions: 40.01-60.00**
  - Examples: Well-controlled hypertension (45.80), stable thyroid disease
  - Routine monitoring with established treatment

- **Historical/resolved conditions: 60.01-80.00**
  - Examples: Past surgeries, resolved pneumonia
  - Relevant for medical history but minimal active management

- **Minor/routine conditions: 80.01-99.99**
  - Examples: Seasonal allergies, minor skin conditions, historical appendectomy (85.00)
  - Minimal clinical significance or intervention needed

### 2. Treatment Complexity & Follow-up Needs
**Weight**: Secondary influence

**Factors**:
- **Multiple medications with interactions**: Lower rank (higher priority)
- **Specialist management requirements**: Lower rank (higher priority)
- **Complex dosing or monitoring**: Lower rank (higher priority)
- **Simple medication management**: Higher rank (lower priority)
- **Self-limiting conditions**: Higher rank (lower priority)

### 3. Patient-Specific Frequency & Impact
**Weight**: Contextual influence

**Considerations**:
- **Recently mentioned/updated conditions**: Lower rank (higher priority)
- **Conditions mentioned across multiple encounters**: Lower rank (higher priority)
- **Long-term stable conditions**: Higher rank (lower priority)
- **Conditions not mentioned recently**: Higher rank (lower priority)
- **Patient-reported symptom burden**: Influences priority weighting

### 4. Current Clinical Relevance
**Weight**: Temporal influence

**Categories**:
- **Conditions actively being treated today: 1.00-20.00**
  - Acute interventions, medication changes, symptom management

- **Conditions requiring medication adjustments: 10.00-30.00**
  - Dose titrations, drug substitutions, monitoring lab values

- **Conditions for routine monitoring: 30.00-50.00**
  - Stable conditions with scheduled follow-ups

- **Stable baseline conditions: 50.00-70.00**
  - Well-controlled chronic diseases

- **Historical reference only: 70.00-99.99**
  - Past conditions relevant for context but not active management

## GPT-4 Intelligence Features

### Medical Synonym Recognition
The ranking system incorporates sophisticated medical intelligence to recognize condition relationships:
- HTN = Hypertension = High Blood Pressure = Essential Hypertension
- DM = Diabetes = Type 2 Diabetes = T2DM = Diabetes Mellitus
- CAD = Coronary Artery Disease = Ischemic Heart Disease = CHD
- CHF = Congestive Heart Failure = Heart Failure = HF

### Condition Evolution Detection
The system recognizes when conditions progress or evolve:
- "Diabetes" → "Diabetes with neuropathy" (same condition, evolved complexity)
- "Hypertension" → "Hypertension with target organ damage" (progression)
- "Heart Failure" → "Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction" (specification)

### ICD-10 Code Family Analysis
Related ICD-10 codes are recognized as variants of the same condition:
- E11.x family = Type 2 Diabetes variations (E11.9, E11.40, E11.21)
- I10-I15 = Hypertensive diseases
- J44.x = COPD family
- I50.x = Heart failure family

## Patient-Specific Context

### Relative Prioritization
Rankings are assigned relative to other conditions the patient has:
- A patient with multiple severe conditions may have their "stable hypertension" ranked lower than someone with hypertension as their primary concern
- The system considers the entire medical complexity of each individual patient

### Encounter Context Integration
Rankings consider both current encounter data and historical attachment information:
- Recent SOAP note mentions increase priority
- Historical document context provides baseline reference
- Frequency across multiple visits influences ranking

## Implementation Technical Details

### Processing Pipeline
1. **GPT-4.1 Analysis**: Each medical condition is analyzed using comprehensive clinical prompts
2. **Multi-factor Evaluation**: All four ranking factors are simultaneously considered
3. **Decimal Precision Assignment**: Unique decimal rankings prevent ties
4. **Reasoning Documentation**: Each ranking includes clinical reasoning explanation
5. **Dynamic Updates**: Rankings adjust as new clinical information becomes available

### Quality Assurance
- **Temperature Setting**: 0.1 for consistent, reliable rankings
- **Structured JSON Output**: Ensures parsing reliability
- **Reasoning Validation**: Each ranking includes explanatory text
- **Error Handling**: Fallback systems for incomplete data

## Clinical Examples

### High Priority Examples
- **Acute myocardial infarction (1.50)**: "Life-threatening acute cardiac event requiring immediate intensive management"
- **Type 2 diabetes with neuropathy (15.25)**: "Complex diabetes with complications requiring active medication management and monitoring"

### Medium Priority Examples
- **Essential hypertension, well controlled (45.80)**: "Stable chronic condition with good control on current regimen"
- **Chronic kidney disease stage 3 (35.20)**: "Progressive condition requiring monitoring and medication adjustments"

### Low Priority Examples
- **History of appendectomy (85.00)**: "Historical surgical condition with no ongoing clinical significance"
- **Seasonal allergies (88.50)**: "Minor condition with minimal intervention requirements"

## User Interface Integration

### Tooltip Display
When users hover over rank badges, they see:
- Current rank number with decimal precision
- Explanation of the four ranking factors
- Scale reference (1.00 = highest, 99.99 = lowest)
- Clinical reasoning for the specific ranking

### Visual Indicators
- Color coding based on priority level
