      )
}

DATA SOURCES TO PROCESS:

${
  soapNote
    ? `
SOAP NOTE CONTENT (Current Encounter - Source: "encounter"):
${soapNote}

SOAP NOTE PROCESSING RULES:
- This is CURRENT encounter data from ${triggerType}
- PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Consolidate and update existing problems intelligently
- BEFORE creating new problems, systematically check for matches using medical synonyms and ICD code families
- Can UPDATE existing diagnoses when they evolve (e.g., DM2 ‚Üí DM2 with neuropathy)
- Can ADD new visit entries to existing problems with current encounter details
- Should use action "EVOLVE_PROBLEM" when diagnosis significantly changes (e.g., E11.9 ‚Üí E11.40)
- Only CREATE new problems when no reasonable match exists in current problem list
- Apply clinical intelligence to recognize condition variations (HTN/Hypertension, DM/Diabetes, etc.)
`
    : triggerType === "manual_edit" 
      ? `
MANUAL RANKING REFRESH REQUEST:
- This is a MANUAL RANKING REFRESH operation
- NO new content to process - focus on RANKING existing problems
- PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Apply intelligent ranking to all existing problems
- MANDATORY: Every existing problem MUST receive ranking_factors and ranking_reason
- Use clinical intelligence to assess relative priority within this patient's context
- Consider clinical severity, treatment complexity, patient frequency, and current relevance
- Generate ONLY ranking_factors with relative percentages that sum to 100% within each category
- DO NOT generate rank_score - frontend will calculate final score using user weight preferences
- Action should be "ADD_VISIT" with empty visit_notes for ranking-only updates
`
      : "NO SOAP NOTE PROVIDED"
}

${
  attachmentContent
    ? `
ATTACHMENT CONTENT (Historical Document - Source: "attachment"):
${attachmentContent}

ATTACHMENT PROCESSING RULES:
- This is HISTORICAL data from attachment ID ${attachmentId}
- PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Enrich existing problems with historical visit data
- MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION FIRST: Before creating any new problem, systematically evaluate if it matches existing problems
- Use advanced medical intelligence to match conditions by meaning, synonyms, abbreviations, and ICD code families
- ADD visit history with historical context to existing problems when condition already exists
- UPDATE existing problems with additional historical visit information and clinical details
- Only CREATE new problems when the condition genuinely doesn't exist in current problem list
- CRITICAL: Extract the PRIMARY document date for ALL medical problems from this attachment
- Look for "Date of Service:", "Date:", "Date/Time:", signature dates, or document headers
- ALL problems from this single attachment should use the SAME extracted document date
- If no specific date found, use null (system will default to current date)
`
    : "NO ATTACHMENT CONTENT PROVIDED"
}

PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Name: ${patient.firstName} ${patient.lastName}
- Age: ${this.calculateAge(patient.dateOfBirth)}
- Processing Date: ${new Date().toISOString()}

COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL DATA AVAILABLE FOR ENHANCED VISIT HISTORIES:
${this.formatPatientChartForGPT(patientChart)}

MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE CONSOLIDATION RULES:
You must use sophisticated medical knowledge to identify matching conditions. Apply this decision tree systematically:

STEP 1 - EXACT MATCH CHECK:
- Problem titles that are identical or near-identical
- Same ICD-10 codes or codes within the same family (e.g., E11.x family for diabetes)

STEP 2 - MEDICAL SYNONYM MATCHING:
Common medical synonyms you MUST recognize and consolidate:
- HTN = Hypertension = High Blood Pressure = Essential Hypertension
- DM = Diabetes = Type 2 Diabetes = T2DM = Diabetes Mellitus
- COPD = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease = Emphysema/Chronic Bronchitis
- CAD = Coronary Artery Disease = Ischemic Heart Disease = CHD
- CHF = Congestive Heart Failure = Heart Failure = HF
- CKD = Chronic Kidney Disease = Chronic Renal Disease
- GERD = Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease = Acid Reflux
- OSA = Obstructive Sleep Apnea = Sleep Apnea
- RA = Rheumatoid Arthritis
- OA = Osteoarthritis = Degenerative Joint Disease
- Depression = Major Depressive Disorder = MDD
- Anxiety = Generalized Anxiety Disorder = GAD
- A-Fib = Atrial Fibrillation = AFib
- PE = Pulmonary Embolism
- DVT = Deep Vein Thrombosis = Deep Venous Thrombosis
- UTI = Urinary Tract Infection
- PUD = Peptic Ulcer Disease
- IBS = Irritable Bowel Syndrome

STEP 3 - CLINICAL CONDITION EVOLUTION:
Recognize when conditions are the same problem with progression:
- "Diabetes" ‚Üí "Diabetes with neuropathy" (same underlying condition, evolved)
- "Hypertension" ‚Üí "Hypertension with target organ damage" (same condition, progression)
- "Heart Failure" ‚Üí "Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction" (same condition, specified)

STEP 4 - ICD-10 CODE FAMILY ANALYSIS:
Conditions sharing ICD-10 prefixes are often the same underlying problem:
- E11.x = Type 2 Diabetes family (E11.9, E11.40, E11.21 are all diabetes variations)
- I10-I15 = Hypertensive diseases
- J44.x = COPD family
- I50.x = Heart failure family

CONFIDENCE SCORING METHODOLOGY - CRITICAL:
The confidence score (0.0-1.0) represents YOUR CONFIDENCE IN YOUR OWN EXTRACTION/INFERENCE ACCURACY, 
NOT the clinical validity of the diagnosis. This helps users decide if they need to review source documents.

CONFIDENCE SCORING FRAMEWORK:

95-100% - EXPLICIT STATEMENTS WITH CLEAR LANGUAGE:
- "Known history of atrial fibrillation" ‚Üí 0.98
- "Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2019" ‚Üí 0.99
- "Patient has hypertension" ‚Üí 0.97
- "Confirmed diagnosis of CHF" ‚Üí 0.98

85-94% - CLEAR CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
- "A1c 10.2%, diagnosed with diabetes" ‚Üí 0.90
- "ECG shows atrial fibrillation" ‚Üí 0.92
- "Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly consistent with CHF" ‚Üí 0.91
- Professional documentation with specific findings ‚Üí 0.85-0.94

70-84% - STRONG IMPLICATIONS BUT NOT EXPLICIT:
- "On metformin for blood sugar control" ‚Üí 0.80 (implies diabetes)
- "Taking warfarin for irregular heartbeat" ‚Üí 0.75 (implies AFib)
- "Patient on lisinopril and HCTZ" ‚Üí 0.72 (implies hypertension)
- Multiple corroborating details ‚Üí 0.70-0.84

50-69% - REASONABLE INFERENCES WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY:
- "Irregularly irregular pulse noted" ‚Üí 0.55 (suggests AFib but not definitive)
- "Blood sugars running high" ‚Üí 0.60 (suggests diabetes)
- "History of heart problems" ‚Üí 0.50 (vague, could be many things)
- Clinical findings suggesting diagnosis ‚Üí 0.50-0.69

30-49% - WEAK EVIDENCE OR CONFLICTING INFORMATION:
- "Patient thinks he might have AFib" ‚Üí 0.40
- "Possible history of diabetes per family" ‚Üí 0.35
- "Questionable cardiac history" ‚Üí 0.30
- Uncertain patient reports ‚Üí 0.30-0.49

10-29% - MINIMAL OR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN INFORMATION:
- "Concerned about heart condition" ‚Üí 0.20
- "Family mentioned something about sugar problems" ‚Üí 0.15
- "Unclear medical history" ‚Üí 0.10
- Vague references ‚Üí 0.10-0.29

1-9% - EXTREMELY UNCERTAIN OR CONTRADICTORY:
- Conflicting information in document ‚Üí 0.05
- Parsing errors or unclear text ‚Üí 0.01-0.09

KEY PRINCIPLES FOR CONFIDENCE SCORING:
1. Rate your extraction accuracy, NOT the diagnosis quality
2. Clear explicit statements = high confidence
3. Inferences from symptoms/meds = medium confidence  
4. Vague or uncertain language = low confidence
5. Words like "thinks", "might", "possible", "questionable" significantly lower confidence
6. Patient self-reports without clinical confirmation = lower confidence
7. Professional clinical documentation = higher confidence

CONFIDENCE-BASED MATCHING THRESHOLDS:
- 50%+ confidence: Likely match, consolidate with detailed reasoning
- 30-49% confidence: Possible match, consolidate if reasonable clinical correlation exists
- <30% confidence: Different conditions, create new problem

UNIFIED PROCESSING INTELLIGENCE:
1. CONSOLIDATION LOGIC: Match conditions when they are medically related (HTN=Hypertension, DM=Diabetes). DO NOT consolidate unrelated conditions (chronic sinusitis + kidney stones makes no sense)
2. SOURCE AWARENESS: Track which source contributed each piece of information
3. CONFLICT RESOLUTION: If same condition appears in both sources, prefer current encounter data for diagnosis, attachment data for historical context
4. VISIT HISTORY ENRICHMENT: Attachment data should add rich historical context to existing problems
5. CLINICAL EVOLUTION: Use "EVOLVE_PROBLEM" when diagnosis changes significantly with ICD code family change
6. CREATE NEW PROBLEMS: When conditions don't match existing problems, create new ones without hesitation

VISIT HISTORY CONSOLIDATION RULES - CRITICAL:
1. ALWAYS check existing visit history for same-date entries before creating new visits
2. When you find existing visits on the SAME DATE as the current document/encounter:
   - ALWAYS CONSOLIDATE information into a single comprehensive visit entry
   - Combine clinical details from both sources into enriched notes
   - Preserve the most complete information from each source
   - NEVER create duplicate same-date visits - ALL same-date information must be consolidated
3. Examples of how to CONSOLIDATE same-date visits:
   - Multiple lab results from same date ‚Üí Single visit with all lab values
   - Progress note + lab results from same date ‚Üí Single visit with exam findings AND lab values
   - Multiple documents from same clinic visit ‚Üí Single comprehensive visit entry
   - Current meds + historical meds ‚Üí "On escitalopram 5mg daily (started 5/23/25). Prior: 10mg daily (3/8/24, 7/2/24)"
4. When consolidating, create rich, comprehensive visit notes that include ALL relevant information from all same-date sources

VISIT HISTORY CREATION RULE - CRITICAL:
ONLY create visit history entries when the medical problem was ACTUALLY DISCUSSED, EVALUATED, or MANAGED during this encounter/document. 

DO NOT create empty, generic, or placeholder visit entries. If a problem was not addressed in this encounter, DO NOT include it in your response.

DATE FORMATTING IN VISIT NOTES - CRITICAL:
When writing dates within visit_notes text, ALWAYS use MM/DD/YY format (not YYYY-MM-DD).
Examples:
- Correct: "Admitted 10/20/13 for acute decompensated HFrEF"
- Incorrect: "Admitted 2013-10-20 for acute decompensated HFrEF"
- Correct: "Last A1c on 3/15/24 was 7.2%"
- Incorrect: "Last A1c on 2024-03-15 was 7.2%"

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN VISIT ENTRIES:
- "No current symptoms"
- "Review of systems negative" 
- "General monitoring"
- "Routine monitoring"
- "No specific diagnosis"
- "Patient denies symptoms"
- "No acute symptoms"
- "Not addressed today"
- "Stable condition"
- Any variation of generic status updates

IF A PROBLEM IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED WITH CLINICAL DETAILS (medications, lab values, symptoms, physical exam findings, treatment changes), DO NOT CREATE A VISIT ENTRY.

PERFECT VISIT HISTORY EXAMPLES (only when problem was actively managed):
- "A1c 10.0, added glipizide 10mg daily. Continue metformin 1000mg BID"
- "A1c 9.2, patient reports dietary lapses. Reinforced lifestyle advice. Continue meds"
- "A1c 8.5, blood glucose logs 130-170. Assess for medication adherence. Plan: Increase metformin to 1000mg BID"
- "A1c 8.4, on metformin 500mg BID. Not at goal, consider adding sulfonylurea if persists"
- "A1c 7.9, continue metformin 500mg BID. Patient started exercise program"
- "A1c 7.7, mild polyuria. Renal panel normal, eye exam scheduled. Continue metformin"
- "A1c 7.4, patient interested in nutrition class. Encouraged"

EXAMPLES OF WHEN NOT TO CREATE VISIT ENTRIES:
- Patient came for knee pain but has diabetes in problem list ‚Üí NO diabetes visit entry
- Attachment mentions "history of hypertension" but no current BP discussed ‚Üí NO hypertension visit entry  
- SOAP note focuses on acute UTI, mentions patient has CHF but no cardiac exam ‚Üí NO CHF visit entry

FORMATTING RULES:
- Include specific lab values, vital signs, medication names/doses
- Use standard medical abbreviations (BP, A1c, BID, etc.)
- Keep entries under 100 characters when possible

ENHANCED VISIT HISTORY WITH CLINICAL DATA CORRELATION:
When building visit histories, you now have access to comprehensive patient chart data. Use this information to create more robust and clinically relevant visit entries:

FOR DIABETES-RELATED PROBLEMS:
- Cross-reference current medications (metformin, insulin, etc.) to enrich visit histories
- Include medication start dates and dosing in visit notes
- Example: "Started on metformin 500mg BID (1/15/23), baseline A1c pending"

FOR HYPERTENSION-RELATED PROBLEMS:
- Include current vital signs in visit notes when clinically relevant
- Correlate BP readings with medication timing
- Example: "BP 140/85 on current lisinopril regimen"

FOR CARDIAC CONDITIONS:
- Include heart rate and blood pressure correlations
- Reference cardiac medications in visit histories
- Example: "HR 72, well controlled on carvedilol 6.25mg BID"

FOR MEDICATION-RELATED PROBLEMS:
- Reference allergy information for medication safety context
- Include medication interactions or contraindications
- Example: "Avoiding ACE inhibitors due to documented cough reaction"

FOR HEREDITARY CONDITIONS:
- Include family history context when creating new genetic/hereditary problems
- Example: "Strong family history of CAD (father: MI at 65), genetic counseling discussed"

CLINICAL DATA INTEGRATION RULES:
1. Only include clinical data that is directly relevant to the specific medical problem
2. Use current medications to provide context for medication-related visit entries
3. Include vital signs when they directly relate to the condition (BP for HTN, HR for arrhythmia)
4. Reference allergies when creating medication-related visit histories
5. Include family history context for genetic predisposition conditions
6. Use social history for lifestyle-related conditions (smoking for COPD, alcohol for liver disease)
- Focus on clinical decision points and changes
- Empty string if no meaningful clinical information
- Use periods to separate distinct clinical facts
- Avoid flowery language or patient education content

RESOLUTION DETECTION RULES:
Look for explicit resolution language in SOAP notes:
- "resolved", "resolution", "resolved per patient report"
- "no longer experiencing", "symptoms resolved", "feeling better"
- "treatment successful", "completed treatment", "cured"
- "acute condition resolved", "infection cleared"
- For acute conditions: automatically consider resolving if patient reports complete symptom resolution
- For chronic conditions: only resolve if explicitly documented as permanently resolved

GPT-POWERED INTELLIGENT RANKING SYSTEM:
For EVERY medical problem (new, updated, or existing), you must provide intelligent ranking based on clinical priority:

RANKING CRITERIA (1.00 = Highest Priority, 99.99 = Lowest Priority):
1. CLINICAL SEVERITY & IMMEDIACY:
   - Life-threatening conditions: 1.00-10.00 (MI, stroke, acute renal failure, sepsis)
   - Urgent conditions requiring monitoring: 10.01-20.00 (uncontrolled diabetes, severe HTN, heart failure)
   - Chronic conditions requiring active management: 20.01-40.00 (controlled diabetes, stable CAD, CKD stages 3-4)
   - Stable chronic conditions: 40.01-60.00 (well-controlled HTN, stable thyroid disease)
   - Historical/resolved conditions: 60.01-80.00 (past surgeries, resolved pneumonia)
   - Minor/routine conditions: 80.01-99.99 (seasonal allergies, minor skin conditions)

2. TREATMENT COMPLEXITY & FOLLOW-UP NEEDS:
   - Multiple medications with interactions: Lower rank (higher priority)
   - Requires specialist management: Lower rank (higher priority)
   - Simple medication management: Higher rank (lower priority)
   - Self-limiting conditions: Higher rank (lower priority)

3. PATIENT-SPECIFIC FREQUENCY & IMPACT:
   - Recently mentioned/updated conditions: Lower rank (higher priority)
   - Conditions mentioned across multiple encounters: Lower rank (higher priority)
   - Long-term stable conditions: Higher rank (lower priority)
   - Conditions not mentioned recently: Higher rank (lower priority)

4. CURRENT CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
   - Conditions actively being treated today: 1.00-20.00
   - Conditions requiring medication adjustments: 10.00-30.00
   - Conditions for routine monitoring: 30.00-50.00
   - Stable baseline conditions: 50.00-70.00
   - Historical reference only: 70.00-99.99

ENHANCED RELATIVE FACTOR SCORING SYSTEM:
For EVERY medical problem, you MUST provide detailed factor breakdown using RELATIVE PERCENTAGES.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Each factor must be distributed as percentages across ALL of this patient's medical problems, where each factor category sums to exactly 100%.

FACTOR 1 - CLINICAL SEVERITY (0-100%):
Compare the clinical severity of THIS patient's conditions against each other:
- Most severe condition for this patient gets highest percentage
- Least severe condition for this patient gets lowest percentage
- All clinical severity percentages across all problems must sum to 100%

FACTOR 2 - TREATMENT COMPLEXITY (0-100%):
Compare the treatment complexity of THIS patient's conditions against each other:
- Most complex treatment regimen for this patient gets highest percentage
- Simplest treatment for this patient gets lowest percentage
- All treatment complexity percentages across all problems must sum to 100%

FACTOR 3 - PATIENT FREQUENCY (0-100%):
Compare how frequently THIS patient's conditions are mentioned/updated:
- Most frequently mentioned condition gets highest percentage
- Least frequently mentioned condition gets lowest percentage
- All patient frequency percentages across all problems must sum to 100%

FACTOR 4 - CLINICAL RELEVANCE (0-100%):
Compare the current clinical relevance of THIS patient's conditions:
- Most currently relevant condition gets highest percentage
- Least currently relevant condition gets lowest percentage
- All clinical relevance percentages across all problems must sum to 100%

RANKING EXAMPLES WITH RELATIVE FACTOR BREAKDOWN:
For a patient with 4 conditions (Type 2 diabetes, CKD Stage 5, Acute sinusitis, Hip osteoarthritis):

- "Type 2 diabetes mellitus with neuropathy" ‚Üí ranking_factors: {"clinical_severity": 40, "treatment_complexity": 50, "patient_frequency": 50, "clinical_relevance": 40}, ranking_reason: "Most complex treatment regimen and frequently managed condition for this patient"
- "CKD Stage 5" ‚Üí ranking_factors: {"clinical_severity": 10, "treatment_complexity": 20, "patient_frequency": 30, "clinical_relevance": 30}, ranking_reason: "Severe but stable condition requiring specialist management"
- "Acute sinusitis" ‚Üí ranking_factors: {"clinical_severity": 30, "treatment_complexity": 10, "patient_frequency": 10, "clinical_relevance": 20}, ranking_reason: "Acute condition but simple treatment compared to chronic conditions"  
- "Hip osteoarthritis" ‚Üí ranking_factors: {"clinical_severity": 20, "treatment_complexity": 20, "patient_frequency": 10, "clinical_relevance": 10}, ranking_reason: "Chronic stable condition with routine management"

MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION: Each factor sums to 100% across all problems:
- Clinical severity: 40 + 10 + 30 + 20 = 100%
- Treatment complexity: 50 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 100%
- Patient frequency: 50 + 30 + 10 + 10 = 100%
- Clinical relevance: 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 100%

RANKING INSTRUCTIONS:
- NEVER assign identical rank scores - use decimal precision to prevent ties
- Consider the ENTIRE patient context when ranking
- Rank relative to OTHER conditions this patient has
- For NEW problems: Rank based on clinical severity and immediacy
- For EXISTING problems: Consider recent changes, stability, and current relevance
- Use ranking_reason to explain your clinical reasoning for the assigned rank
- MANDATORY: Provide ranking_factors breakdown for EVERY medical problem using the 4-factor scoring system above

INSTRUCTION: Systematically evaluate medical conditions against existing problems using consolidation rules. When SOAP notes document problem resolution, use RESOLVE action. Create new problems when conditions don't reasonably match existing ones. For ALL problems (new/updated/existing), provide intelligent ranking with clinical reasoning. Document consolidation reasoning and ranking reasoning in respective fields.
