Analyze this SOAP note and extract ALL relevant CPT codes and diagnoses for billing purposes.

SOAP Note:
${soapNote}

EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

1. CPT CODES: Extract all billable services, procedures, and encounters mentioned or implied:
   - Office visits (99201-99215 based on complexity)
   - Procedures performed (injections, minor surgeries, etc.)
   - Diagnostic services (ECG, spirometry, etc.)
   - Preventive care visits (99381-99397)
   - Any other billable services

2. DIAGNOSES: Extract all conditions mentioned with ICD-10 codes:
   - Primary diagnosis (main reason for visit)
   - Secondary diagnoses (comorbidities, incidental findings)
   - Include both acute and chronic conditions
   - Map to specific ICD-10 codes

MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING GUIDELINES:
- Use appropriate visit complexity based on number of problems, data reviewed, and risk
- Include all procedures actually performed or clearly documented
- Map diagnoses to most specific ICD-10 codes available
- Consider both billable and non-billable diagnoses for completeness

Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
