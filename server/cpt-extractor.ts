Analyze this clinical documentation and determine appropriate CPT codes and diagnoses for billing purposes.

Clinical Documentation:
${soapNote}

CODING REQUIREMENTS:

1. CPT CODES: Determine and assign appropriate billing codes for all services provided:
   - Office visits (99201-99215): Assess complexity based on:
     * Number of problems addressed (straightforward=1, low=2, moderate=3-4, high=5+)
     * Amount of data reviewed (labs, imaging, records)
     * Risk level (minimal, low, moderate, high)
   - Procedures performed: Assign specific CPT codes for any injections, minor surgeries, biopsies
   - Diagnostic services: Code for ECG, spirometry, vision screening, etc. if performed
   - Preventive care visits (99381-99397): If this is a wellness/physical exam
   - Any other billable services actually provided

2. DIAGNOSES: Assign accurate ICD-10 codes for all conditions addressed:
   - Primary diagnosis: Main reason for this visit
   - Secondary diagnoses: Additional conditions managed or affecting care
   - Include both acute conditions and chronic disease management
   - Use most specific ICD-10 codes available

MEDICAL CODING GUIDELINES:
- Base visit complexity on actual clinical work documented
- Only code procedures that were actually performed, not just discussed
- Assign the most specific and accurate ICD-10 codes
- Ensure CPT codes match the level of service actually provided
- Consider medical necessity for all assigned codes

Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
