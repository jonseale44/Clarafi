    nursing_assessment: `${basePrompt}

Generate a comprehensive nursing assessment from this transcription using professional nursing standards and proper medical abbreviations.

**REQUIRED SECTIONS (only include if data is available):**

**NURSING ASSESSMENT:**
- Chief concern from nursing perspective (patient's primary worry/discomfort)
- General appearance and condition
- Vital signs and measurements with trending
- Pain assessment using 0-10 scale with location, quality, duration
- Mobility status and ADL independence level
- Fall risk assessment (High/Moderate/Low Risk)
- Skin integrity assessment
- Mental status and cognitive function
- Mood and coping mechanisms
- Educational needs and health literacy level
- Family dynamics and support system availability
- Discharge planning considerations

**NURSING DIAGNOSES:**
Use NANDA-approved nursing diagnoses with specific criteria:
- Primary nursing diagnosis with supporting evidence
- Secondary nursing diagnoses as appropriate
- Risk factors clearly identified with rationale
- Patient's current responses to interventions
- Nursing diagnosis priority ranking

**NURSING PRIORITIES:**
- Immediate safety concerns requiring intervention
- Pain management and comfort measures
- Patient education priorities for this admission
- Medication reconciliation concerns
- Discharge planning needs

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use bullet points with hyphens (-) for ALL items
- Apply standard medical abbreviations consistently
- Include specific measurements and observations
- Use professional nursing terminology
- Organize by clinical priority
- Include only documented findings

**EXAMPLE FORMAT:**
**NURSING ASSESSMENT:**
- Chief concern: CP rated 7/10, substernal, radiating to left arm
- General appearance: Alert, oriented x3, appears uncomfortable secondary to pain
- Vital signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 88 BPM, RR 20/min, T 98.6Â°F, O2 Sat 96% on RA
- Pain: 7/10 substernal CP, crushing quality, onset 2 hours ago, relieved partially with NTG
- Mobility: Independent with ADLs, no assistive devices required
- Fall risk: Low risk, steady gait, no orthostatic changes
- Skin integrity: Intact throughout, no pressure areas noted
- Mental status: Alert and oriented x3, appropriate responses
- Educational needs: Requires teaching on cardiac diet and medication compliance

**NURSING DIAGNOSES:**
- Acute Pain related to myocardial tissue ischemia as evidenced by patient report of 7/10 substernal CP
- Risk for Decreased Cardiac Output related to compromised myocardial contractility
- Deficient Knowledge related to cardiac diet and medication regimen

Format as professional nursing documentation suitable for EMR entry and nursing handoff.`,

    care_plan: `${basePrompt}

Generate a comprehensive nursing care plan from this transcription using NANDA nursing diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions.

**NURSING CARE PLAN STRUCTURE:**

For each identified nursing diagnosis, provide:
- **Nursing Diagnosis:** [NANDA-approved diagnosis with related to and as evidenced by]
- **Expected Outcomes:** [Specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-bound goals]
- **Nursing Interventions:** [Evidence-based interventions with rationale]
- **Evaluation Criteria:** [Specific measurements to assess goal achievement]

**PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS:**
- Immediate safety measures and risk mitigation
- Pain management protocols and comfort measures
- Patient education priorities with specific topics
- Medication administration and monitoring
- Discharge planning and continuity of care

**EXAMPLE CARE PLAN FORMAT:**

**NURSING DIAGNOSIS #1:**
- Acute Pain related to surgical incision as evidenced by patient report of 8/10 incisional pain and guarding behavior

**EXPECTED OUTCOMES:**
- Patient will report pain level â‰¤ 3/10 within 30 minutes of pain medication administration
- Patient will demonstrate improved mobility and decreased guarding within 24 hours

- Administer prescribed analgesics as ordered and evaluate effectiveness
- Position patient for comfort and support surgical site
- Teach patient about pain management options and when to request medication
- Encourage use of incentive spirometer to prevent respiratory complications
- Document pain assessments and interventions in patient record

- Provided education on post-operative care including incision care and activity restrictions
- Contacted family member (daughter) to update on patient status and discharge planning
- Implemented fall precautions including bed alarm and non-slip socks
- Repositioned patient every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers
- Encouraged use of incentive spirometer every hour while awake

**PATIENT RESPONSES:**
- Pain decreased from 8/10 to 4/10 within 20 minutes of morphine administration
