- **GPT UNIFIED PARSER EMPOWERED**: GPT now has full control over both intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical problem processing decisions
- **SCOPE-AGNOSTIC PROCESSING**: `getExistingProblems` retrieves ALL patient problems regardless of creation time, allowing GPT to handle both same-visit updates and cross-visit evolution
- **INTELLIGENT CONTEXT DISTINCTION**: GPT can distinguish "same visit, more details" vs "new visit, condition evolved" using trigger type and existing problem history
