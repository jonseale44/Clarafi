## Deployment Workflow

### Production Environment
- **Live URL**: https://clarafi.ai
- **AWS Region**: us-east-2 (Ohio)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS App Runner (HIPAA compliant with BAA)
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL at clarafi-db.ca54qe20gs6u.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- **DNS**: Route 53 managing clarafi.ai domain
- **Security Group**: sg-097abc98448fc28f1 (configured with PostgreSQL inbound rule on port 5432 from 0.0.0.0/0)
- **Security Group**: sg-097abc98448fc28f1 (configured with PostgreSQL inbound rule on port 5432 from 0.0.0.0/0)

### Deployment Process
1. **Development**: Make changes in Replit and test locally
2. **Commit**: Push changes to GitHub `main2` branch (NOT main)
3. **Deploy**: Manually trigger deployment in AWS App Runner console
   - Log into AWS Console ‚Üí App Runner ‚Üí clarafi service ‚Üí Click "Deploy"
   - Automatic GitHub deployments are NOT working - must be done manually
4. **Monitor**: Check deployment logs and verify at https://clarafi.ai

### Important Notes
- Full deployment guide: See `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
- Emergency rollback: Use App Runner's "Deploy this version" feature
- Environment variables: Managed in App Runner configuration
- Cost: ~$25-45/month (App Runner + RDS)

## Recent Changes

### August 1, 2025 - AWS RDS SSL Certificate Fix
- ‚úÖ Resolved "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" error in production
- ‚úÖ Added AWS global certificate bundle to project at `server/certs/aws-global-bundle.pem`
- ‚úÖ Updated db.ts to use certificate bundle for proper SSL validation instead of disabling verification
- ‚úÖ This provides secure SSL connections to AWS RDS with proper certificate validation
- ‚úÖ Certificate bundle contains all AWS root certificates needed for RDS connections

### July 31, 2025 - Production Database Connection Fix
- ‚úÖ Fixed 500 error on `/api/check-email` endpoint at https://clarafi.ai
- ‚úÖ Root cause: RDS security group was missing PostgreSQL inbound rule
- ‚úÖ Solution: Added inbound rule for PostgreSQL (port 5432) from 0.0.0.0/0 to security group sg-097abc98448fc28f1
- ‚úÖ This allows AWS App Runner to connect to RDS database across regions (App Runner in us-east-2, RDS in us-east-1)

### July 31, 2025 - Priority 2 Technical Debt Resolution Progress
- ‚úÖ Fixed magic link route mismatch: Changed email URLs from `/api/auth/magic-link/${token}` to `/auth/magic-link/${token}`
- ‚úÖ Completed standardizing error messages across ALL email verification systems:
  - ‚úÖ Updated magic-link-routes.ts to use consistent `{ success: false, message: '...' }` format
  - ‚úÖ Updated admin-verification-routes.ts to use consistent `{ success: false, message: '...' }` format
  - ‚úÖ All error responses now follow the same pattern for better frontend handling
- üîÑ Next priority: Normalizing success response formats for consistency

### July 31, 2025 - Tier 3 Removal & System Simplification
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR CHANGE**: Removed Tier 3 from the entire system
- ‚úÖ Updated database schema: Changed `tier3_verified` to `tier2_verified` 
- ‚úÖ Modified subscription tiers to only support Tier 1 (Individual) and Tier 2 (Enterprise)
- ‚úÖ Updated all TypeScript types and interfaces to remove tier 3 references
- ‚úÖ Modified Stripe integration to only handle 2 tiers

### July 30, 2025 - OpenAI Realtime API Troubleshooting
**Issue**: Intermittent 403 Forbidden errors during voice transcription despite successful WebSocket connections.

**Root Cause**: Whisper API must be enabled in OpenAI account settings for the Realtime API transcription to work.

**Solution**: Enable Whisper in your OpenAI account settings. The 403 errors are not related to API key security or WebSocket implementation.

**Key Learning**: The OpenAI Realtime API requires both:
1. A valid API key with Realtime API access
2. Whisper enabled for transcription functionality

### July 29-30, 2025 - AWS Deployment Migration - MAJOR CHANGE
**Decision**: After 2.5+ hours of failed Elastic Beanstalk attempts, switching to AWS App Runner.

**Reason**: Elastic Beanstalk has a critical bug with Node.js 20 platform repeatedly failing with:
- "Unknown or duplicate parameter: NodeVersion"
- "Unknown or duplicate parameter: NodeCommand"

This occurred even with:
- Brand new applications
- Minimal configurations
- Clean files with no NodeVersion/NodeCommand parameters

**New Implementation**: AWS App Runner
- No configuration files needed (no .ebextensions)
- Still HIPAA compliant with BAA
- Simpler deployment (5 minutes vs hours of debugging)
- Automatic scaling and HTTPS included
- GitHub integration for auto-deployment

**Key Files**:
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Complete documentation of EB failures
- `AWS_APP_RUNNER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - New deployment guide
- `.ebextensions/` - Now in `.ebextensions.full-backup` (not needed for App Runner)

**Status**: Proceeding with App Runner deployment

**Progress**: 
- ‚úÖ AWS account created with Business support plan
- ‚úÖ BAA accepted in AWS Artifact (HIPAA compliance active)
- ‚úÖ SSH keypair created with passphrase: Yregru$44
- ‚úÖ RDS PostgreSQL database created: clarafi-db.ca54qe20gs6u.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- ‚úÖ Database credentials: clarafiadmin / Yregru$55555
- ‚úÖ App Runner service created with GitHub integration
- ‚úÖ All environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Production path resolution fixed (replaced process.cwd() with safe path utilities)
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub for automatic deployment
- ‚úÖ Code successfully pushed to GitHub main2 branch
- ‚úÖ All environment variables configured in App Runner (including STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
- üîÑ Ready for App Runner deployment - user needs to change branch to main2 and save
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Automatic deployments from GitHub do NOT work - must manually press "Deploy" in App Runner console after each push
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed port configuration - app now uses PORT env variable instead of hardcoded 5000
- ‚úÖ Fixed production path resolution - removed import.meta.dirname error by using dynamic imports
- ‚úÖ Fixed EFaxService path.resolve error - made uploads directory resolution lazy
- ‚úÖ Created vite-wrapper.ts to prevent vite bundling in production
- ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to production at https://clarafi.ai

### July 29, 2025 - WebAuthn Passkey Fix
**Issue**: Passkey registration failed when deployed due to hardcoded RP ID (Relying Party ID) set to Replit development domain.

**Solution**: Made WebAuthn configuration dynamic:
- Updated `WebAuthnService` to determine RP ID and origin dynamically based on the request
- Added support for `PRODUCTION_DOMAIN` environment variable
- Modified all WebAuthn methods to accept an optional origin parameter
- Updated routes to pass the origin from request headers to the service

**Key Changes**:
1. Added `getRPID()` and `getOrigin()` methods that check for production domain first, then fall back to request origin or Replit dev domain
2. Updated all WebAuthn service methods to accept origin parameter:
   - `generateRegistrationOptions(userId, origin?)`
   - `verifyRegistrationResponse(userId, response, challenge, origin?)`
   - `generateAuthenticationOptions(email?, origin?)`
   - `verifyAuthenticationResponse(response, challenge, origin?)`
3. Updated all WebAuthn routes to extract origin from request headers and pass to service methods

**Environment Variable**: Set `PRODUCTION_DOMAIN` to your production domain (e.g., `myapp.com`) to ensure proper passkey functionality in production.

**Important Note about Iframe Deployment**: Passkeys will not work when the site is accessed through an iframe (such as Replit's deployment preview) due to browser security restrictions. The parent frame must explicitly allow `publickey-credentials-create` and `publickey-credentials-get` permissions in its Permissions-Policy header. For full passkey functionality, the site must be:
1. Accessed directly (not through an iframe), OR
2. Embedded in an iframe that includes: `Permissions-Policy: publickey-credentials-create=(self "https://yourdomain.com"), publickey-credentials-get=(self "https://yourdomain.com")`
