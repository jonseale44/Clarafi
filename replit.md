## Recent Changes (July 23, 2025)

### Mobile Optimization for Median Native App (PatientChartView & EncounterView)
Implemented comprehensive mobile optimizations for both PatientChartView and EncounterDetailView components to work seamlessly in the Median native app:

1. **Added Data-Median Attributes** - Tagged all key UI elements with `data-median` attributes for CSS/JS targeting
2. **Enhanced React-Based Solution** - Uses `window.isMedianMobile` flag set by Median JS override for native React state management
3. **Controlled Sidebar State** - UnifiedChartPanel accepts `isOpen`/`onOpenChange` props for proper state control
4. **View-Specific Defaults** - Patient chart view defaults to open and full-width (100vw), encounter view defaults to closed (85vw max 350px)
5. **Mobile New Encounter Button** - Relocated New Encounter button to encounters section in sidebar on mobile
6. **Hidden Right-Side Content** - Right-side content hidden on mobile except New Encounter button
7. **Conditional Mobile UI** - Menu toggle button only renders when `isMedianMobile` is true
8. **Touch Optimizations** - Minimum 44px touch targets, swipe-to-close gesture support
9. **Responsive Layout** - Header elements stack on mobile, full-width buttons on small screens
10. **Web Overrides Created** - Comprehensive CSS and JS overrides documented in `median-web-overrides.md`
11. **Fixed Sidebar Default State** - UnifiedChartPanel now correctly defaults to closed for encounter view on mobile
12. **Mobile Menu Toggle** - Added hamburger menu button in encounter view header that only appears on mobile
13. **Close Button in Sidebar** - Added X close button in sidebar header that only appears on mobile

Key implementation details:
- React-based detection using `window.isMedianMobile` flag (requires JavaScript override in Median dashboard)
- Sidebar controlled via React props (`isOpen`, `onOpenChange`, `isPatientChartView`)
- Patient chart view opens by default on mobile with full screen width
- Encounter view starts closed on mobile with slide-over behavior for provider documentation focus
- New Encounter button renders in encounters section when on mobile
- Mobile menu toggle conditionally rendered only in Median app
- Close button in sidebar header visible only on mobile
- Selecting a chart section auto-closes sidebar on mobile (encounter view only)
- Body scroll locked when sidebar is open (handled in React)
- Swipe left gesture closes sidebar (via JS override)
- CSS classes applied conditionally based on mobile state and view type

**Important**: Both CSS and JavaScript overrides must be added in Median dashboard for mobile detection to work properly.

### Fixed Allergy Source Badge Linking Issue  
Resolved issue where allergy badges from attachments weren't linking to source documents:

1. **Root Cause Identified** - `extractedFromAttachmentId` field was null in database for attachment-extracted allergies
2. **Updated GPT Prompt** - Added explicit instruction for GPT to include attachmentId in visitEntry when processing attachments
3. **Frontend Fallback** - Added logic to check visitHistory for attachmentId if extractedFromAttachmentId is null
4. **Conditional Clickability** - Badge is only clickable when attachment ID exists, with appropriate visual feedback

### Fixed Medication Intelligent Grouping Infinite Loop
Resolved critical issue where medications were flashing and disappearing due to infinite API calls:

1. **Replaced useEffect with React Query** - Removed problematic useEffect that was causing infinite loops
2. **Added Proper Caching** - Implemented 30-second stale time and 5-minute cache time for grouping results
3. **Stable Query Keys** - Created stable medication ID keys to prevent unnecessary refetches
4. **Maintained Polling** - Preserved 2-second medication polling without triggering grouping API calls
5. **Fixed State Management** - Removed useState for intelligent groups in favor of React Query data

### Enhanced Patient Parser Logging
Added comprehensive logging and validation to diagnose and fix "Invalid MIME type" errors when parsing patient information from images:

1. **Request Logging** - Logs incoming request details, image data length, and MIME type
2. **Image Data Validation** - Checks if data has data URL prefix and validates base64 format
3. **MIME Type Validation** - Ensures only OpenAI-supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
4. **HEIF/HEIC Detection** - Warns users these formats aren't supported by OpenAI
5. **Enhanced Error Messages** - Provides specific feedback about unsupported formats
6. **Base64 Validation** - Ensures image data is properly encoded

### Fixed NoteTypeSelector toString() Error in Mobile App
Resolved "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'item.toString')" error in NoteTypeSelector component:

1. **Root Cause** - `getCurrentValue()` method was checking if `selectedTemplate` prop existed but not if it had a value
2. **Fixed Logic** - Added proper null check `selectedTemplate && selectedTemplate.id` before accessing properties
3. **Fallback Value** - Added default fallback to "soap" to prevent undefined from being passed to Select component
4. **Impact** - Fixes mobile app crash when clicking on encounters in patient chart view

### Fixed Stripe Runtime Error in Mobile App
Resolved Stripe initialization error that was causing "Please call Stripe() with your publishable key" overlay:

1. **Root Cause** - Payment page was initializing Stripe with empty string when `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` was undefined
2. **Fixed Logic** - Added conditional initialization: only create stripePromise if publishable key exists
3. **UI Fallback** - Added user-friendly message when Stripe is not configured instead of crashing
4. **Impact** - Prevents runtime error overlay from blocking the app when Stripe keys are not set

### Photo Capture Flow
- Photos are uploaded via `/api/photo-capture/sessions/:sessionId/upload`
- Stored in `/uploads/photo-capture/` directory
- Served with proper MIME types via Express static middleware
- Client fetches photos and converts to base64 before sending to patient parser

### QR Code Photo Capture in Patient Attachments
Replicated the QR code photo capture functionality from PatientParser to the patient attachments section:

1. **Added Photo Capture States** - Session management, QR code display, and polling logic
2. **QR Code Generation** - Creates scannable QR codes for mobile photo capture
3. **Session Polling** - Polls for uploaded photos every 2 seconds
4. **Automatic OCR Processing** - Photos are automatically processed with GPT-4 Vision when uploaded
5. **UI Integration** - Added "Capture Photo with Mobile Device" button alongside traditional upload
6. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages and cleanup on failure

The OCR processing happens automatically through the existing document analysis pipeline:
- Files uploaded as attachments are queued for processing
- GPT-4 Vision extracts text, generates titles, and classifies document types
- Results are stored in the `attachmentExtractedContent` table

### Mobile Optimization for Encounter View in Median Native App
Implemented mobile-specific behaviors for encounter-detail-view component:

1. **Mobile Detection** - Added isMedianMobile detection with fallback to screen width (â‰¤768px)
2. **Default Closed Sidebar** - Encounter view starts with sidebar closed for provider documentation focus
3. **Mobile Menu Toggle** - Added menu button in header that only appears in Median app
4. **Mobile Overlay** - Added dark overlay backdrop when sidebar is open on mobile
5. **State Management** - Added mobileSidebarOpen state to control sidebar visibility
6. **Props Propagation** - All mobile-specific props passed to UnifiedChartPanel
7. **Consistent Architecture** - Same mobile detection and state pattern as patient-chart-view
