# Enhanced Content-Based Visit History Deduplication Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented enhanced content-based deduplication across all major medical chart parsers to prevent duplicate visit history entries when the same medical documents are uploaded multiple times.

## Root Cause Analysis

When a medical document (like an H&P) is uploaded multiple times:
- Each upload receives a different attachment ID
- Simple ID-based deduplication fails because attachment IDs differ
- This causes duplicate visit history entries with identical content

## Solution Implemented

Enhanced all major parsers with content-based deduplication that includes:

### 1. Content Similarity Detection
- Added `calculateSimilarity` method to compute string similarity (0-1 scale)
- Added `levenshteinDistance` algorithm for accurate similarity measurement
- Set 90% similarity threshold for duplicate detection

### 2. Enhanced FilterDuplicateVisitEntries Method
All parsers now use enhanced deduplication with:
- **ID-based filtering**: Prevents duplicates from same encounter/attachment
- **Content normalization**: Lowercase conversion and whitespace normalization
- **Exact match detection**: Immediate removal of identical content
- **Similarity threshold**: Removes entries with >90% similarity on same date

### 3. Parsers Enhanced

#### Medical Problems Parser
- Enhanced `filterDuplicateVisitEntries` with content-based logic
- Proactive filtering in `applyUnifiedChanges` method
- Pattern: Normalized content + similarity calculation

#### Imaging Parser
- Enhanced with content deduplication
- Added calculateSimilarity method
- 90% similarity threshold for near-duplicates

#### Family History Parser
- Added complete deduplication logic (was missing entirely)
- Fixed method parameters
- Content-based filtering with similarity checking

#### Surgical History Parser  
- Enhanced from basic ID filtering to content-based
- Added calculateSimilarity and levenshteinDistance methods
- Updated method signature with newVisitNotes and newVisitDate parameters

#### Medications Delta Service
- Enhanced all three filterDuplicateVisitEntries locations
- Added content similarity checking
- Updated all method calls with new parameters

#### Social History Parser
- Already had enhanced deduplication (served as reference implementation)
- Pattern followed by other parsers

## Technical Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Enhanced deduplication pattern used across all parsers
private filterDuplicateVisitEntries(
  existingVisits: VisitHistoryEntry[],
  encounterId: number | null,
  attachmentId: number | null,
  sourceType: "encounter" | "attachment",
  newVisitNotes: string,
  newVisitDate: string
): VisitHistoryEntry[] {
  return existingVisits.filter((visit) => {
    // ID-based filtering
    if (encounterId && visit.encounterId === encounterId) {
      return visit.source !== sourceType;
    }
    if (attachmentId && visit.attachmentId === attachmentId) {
      return false;
    }

    // Content-based deduplication
    const normalizedExisting = visit.notes.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
    const normalizedNew = newVisitNotes.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
    
    // Exact match
    if (normalizedExisting === normalizedNew) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Similarity check
    const similarity = this.calculateSimilarity(normalizedExisting, normalizedNew);
    if (similarity > 0.9 && visit.date === newVisitDate) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Duplicate Content**: Same document uploaded multiple times creates only one visit history entry
2. **Handles Near-Duplicates**: 90% similarity threshold catches minor variations
3. **Maintains Data Integrity**: Legitimate different visits are preserved
4. **Consistent Implementation**: All chart sections use same deduplication logic

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Same Document Multiple Uploads**: Upload same H&P twice → Only one visit history entry
2. **Similar Content Same Date**: Minor text variations → Detected as duplicate
3. **Similar Content Different Dates**: Same content on different days → Preserved as separate visits
4. **Different Sources**: Encounter vs attachment on same encounter → Both preserved

## Production Impact

- Users can safely re-upload documents without creating duplicate visit histories
- Chart sections remain clean and accurate
- Visit history accurately reflects actual medical events
- Consistent behavior across all EMR chart sections
