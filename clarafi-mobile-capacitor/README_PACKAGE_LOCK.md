# Package Lock File Issue

The `package-lock.json` file needs to be regenerated locally before pushing to Git.

## Steps to fix:

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Navigate to `clarafi-mobile-capacitor` directory
3. Run `npm install` to generate a complete package-lock.json
4. Commit and push the updated package-lock.json file
5. Trigger a new build in Appflow

## Why this is needed:

Appflow uses `npm ci` which requires a complete package-lock.json file. The current lock file is incomplete and missing dependency resolution data.

## What's been fixed already:

- ✓ Removed unused imports from Home.tsx and PatientList.tsx
- ✓ Fixed vite.config.ts by removing @vitejs/plugin-legacy
- ✓ Fixed React Router v6 compatibility issues (removed `exact` props)
- ✓ All TypeScript compilation errors are resolved

Once you generate and push a proper package-lock.json, the build should complete successfully.
