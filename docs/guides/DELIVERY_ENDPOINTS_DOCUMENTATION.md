# Order Delivery Endpoints - Implementation Status

## Current Implementation Status

### LAB ORDERS
1. **Mock Service (DEFAULT)** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & FUNCTIONAL
   - Route: Handled by existing lab workflow
   - File: `server/lab-order-processor.ts`
   - Endpoint: Orders are processed through existing lab background service
   - Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL - generates mock results, creates lab orders table entries

2. **Real Service** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need external lab service integration (Quest, LabCorp, etc.)
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

3. **Print PDF** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED  
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need PDF generation service
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

### IMAGING ORDERS
1. **Mock Service** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY  
   - Future Implementation: Would need mock imaging service similar to lab service
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

2. **Real Service** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need external imaging service integration
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

3. **Print PDF (DEFAULT)** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need PDF generation service  
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

### MEDICATION ORDERS  
1. **Preferred Pharmacy (DEFAULT)** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need pharmacy integration (SureScripts, etc.)
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

2. **Print PDF** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Future Implementation: Would need PDF generation service
   - Current Behavior: Option exists in UI but no actual endpoint/processing

## Summary
- **FUNCTIONAL ENDPOINTS**: 1 out of 8 (Mock Lab Service only)
- **PLACEHOLDER ENDPOINTS**: 7 out of 8 (everything else)

## Current Working Flow
Only the Mock Lab Service actually processes orders:
1. User creates lab orders in encounter
2. Orders are signed 
3. `lab-order-processor.ts` picks them up automatically
4. Mock results are generated and stored in `lab_orders` and `lab_results` tables
5. Results appear in patient lab results section

## Critical Developer Warning
⚠️ **All other delivery options are UI-only preferences with NO backend processing**
⚠️ **Orders will appear to be "sent" but nothing actually happens**
⚠️ **This could lead to orders being lost in production if not properly implemented**

## Next Steps for Full Implementation
1. PDF Generation Service (affects 4 endpoints)
2. Real Lab Service Integration (1 endpoint) 
3. Imaging Mock Service (1 endpoint)
4. Real Imaging Service Integration (1 endpoint)
5. Pharmacy Integration Service (1 endpoint)
