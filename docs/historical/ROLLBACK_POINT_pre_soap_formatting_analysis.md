# Rollback Point: Pre-SOAP Formatting Analysis
## Date: June 26, 2025
## Status: Before any changes to SOAP note formatting system

This rollback point was created before analyzing and potentially refactoring the SOAP note creation and formatting system.

## Current System State:
- User Edit Lock System: Fully implemented and functional
- SOAP Note Generation: Consolidated system using EnhancedNoteGenerationService
- Multiple formatting layers: GPT prompts, React formatting, TipTap editor
- Complex state management for user edits and real-time updates
- Multiple editor implementations across components

## Files to Monitor for Changes:
- client/src/components/patient/encounter-detail-view.tsx
- client/src/components/RealtimeSOAPIntegration.tsx
- client/src/components/ui/soap-note-editor.tsx
- server/enhanced-note-generation-service.ts
- client/src/components/NursingTemplateAssessment.tsx

## Key Functionality Preserved:
- Real-time SOAP generation during recording
- User edit protection system
- Auto-save functionality
- Custom template support
- Multiple note types (SOAP, H&P, Progress, etc.)

## Technical Debt Identified:
- Multiple formatting transformation layers
- Inconsistent editor implementations
- Complex state management for user edits
- Fragmented content processing pipeline
- Legacy code dependencies

This rollback point allows safe return to current working state if refactoring causes issues.
