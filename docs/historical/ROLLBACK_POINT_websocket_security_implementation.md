# ROLLBACK POINT: Before WebSocket Security Implementation
Date: January 7, 2025 at 1:19 PM

## Purpose
Creating a rollback point before implementing critical security fixes to move OpenAI API key from client-side to server-side WebSocket proxy.

## Current State
- **Security Vulnerability**: VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY exposed in browser code
- **AI Features Working**: All transcription, suggestions, SOAP generation, and chart processing functional
- **WebSocket Connection**: Direct browser-to-OpenAI connection using exposed API key
- **Server API Calls**: Already secure (using process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY)

## Files That Will Be Modified
1. **Frontend WebSocket Components**:
   - `client/src/components/patient/encounter-detail-view.tsx` (OpenAI WebSocket connection)
   - `client/src/components/patient/nursing-encounter-view.tsx` (OpenAI WebSocket connection)
   - `client/src/components/RealtimeAPISettings.tsx` (API key references)

2. **New Server Files to Create**:
   - `server/realtime-proxy-service.ts` (WebSocket proxy)
   - `server/realtime-proxy-routes.ts` (WebSocket endpoint)

## Functionality to Preserve
- Voice transcription via OpenAI Whisper
- Real-time AI clinical suggestions
- SOAP note generation (already server-side)
- Chart processing (already server-side)
- All existing message formats and protocols

## Security Issue Being Fixed
- Browser-exposed API key (VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY) visible in DevTools
- Direct browser-to-OpenAI WebSocket connections bypassing server security
- No audit trail for real-time AI interactions

## Rollback Instructions
If issues arise after security implementation:
1. User can use the rollback button in the chat interface
2. This will restore all files to their state at this timestamp
3. The exposed API key vulnerability will return but all features will work

## Notes
- User has created new OPENAI_API_KEY (server-side only)
- VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY should be removed entirely, not replaced
- All AI functionality must continue working identically after security fix
