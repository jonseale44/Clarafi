# CMS PECOS Data Acquisition Guide

## Overview
PECOS (Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System) contains the authoritative organizational hierarchy data for US healthcare providers, including true ownership chains, parent-subsidiary relationships, and corporate structures.

## Why PECOS vs NPPES?
- **NPPES**: Flat registry, no hierarchy information, publicly available
- **PECOS**: Complete ownership chains, organizational relationships, requires Data Use Agreement (DUA)

## Steps to Obtain PECOS Data

### 1. Register for CMS Enterprise Portal (1-2 weeks)
- Go to https://portal.cms.gov
- Click "New User Registration"
- Select "I want to access CMS data for research/business purposes"
- Complete identity verification (requires SSN, address verification)
- Wait for approval email (typically 3-5 business days)

### 2. Request PECOS Data Access (2-3 weeks)
Once registered:
- Log into CMS Enterprise Portal
- Navigate to "CMS Data" â†’ "Request Data"
- Select "PECOS Provider Enrollment Data"
- Complete the Data Use Agreement (DUA) form:
  - Purpose: "Healthcare provider directory management"
  - Data elements needed: Organization relationships, ownership chains
  - Security measures: Describe your data protection protocols
  - Intended use: EMR system provider directory

### 3. Data Use Agreement Requirements

### 4. Review and Approval (2-4 weeks)

- Legal review of your organization
- Final approval notification

### 5. Data Access and Format
Once approved:
- Access via SFTP or secure download
- Format: CSV files with multiple tables
- Key tables:
  - `ENROLLMENT`: Basic provider information
